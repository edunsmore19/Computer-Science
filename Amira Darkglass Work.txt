\f0\fs24 \cf0 Outside in what has been described as an order less mess of cars that should have been scrapped many years before a girls body is being dragged towards an old house This house looks like a war veteran patches upon patches held together by scars with the occasional appendage missing but is in no way crippled and void to pity Sometimes if you look close enough you can sometimes even see the strange marks of warding symbols on the windows but then again you probably shouldnt get that close because there are tales about that house and its inhabitants that would chill your blood\
\
MROWWWWW A white tiger shrieks to the inhabitants of the veteran house who are always listening when they arent either drunk fighting or saving the world\
\
The jaws of the tiger are firmly lodged in the clothing of the girl who is a probably twentysomething brown haired college graduate Freckles pattern her pale skin and her hair is streaked with ginger and gold from the California sun where she has been visiting her parents The tiger stops and gives another yowl to alert anybody nearby that her mistress is in need of immediate attention Blood seeps from our twentysomething and bubbles out of her throat her clothes are encrusted in dried blood in the places where her body has given up trying to bleed\
\
The white tiger heaved the girl up the two steps that led to the door of the house before lowering her gently to the ground The white tiger hit the door with her paw in ways of a knock keeping her claws sheathed wary of ruining the peeling paint job that had everyone so wonderfully convinced that this house has been abandoned long ago\
\
From inside of the house comes a yell\
\
Someones at the door Sammy The voice comes from deep within the basement of the house where a muscular man stands with his hands sliding back and forth over a silver knife with a long wooden handle Another man is in the basement where the first stands but he is chained to a chair inside of a devils trap and makes no move to speak\
\
Dont call me Sammy Dean Retorts Sam ever witty But its not his fault that he is distracted after all nobody ever visits the house Not since since Bobby Sam shook away the thought as he rose from where he had been sitting in the kitchen researching a series of strange deaths that had recently started to sweep through Lafayette California\
\
What had peaked his interest initially had been a fire which had ripped through a middle school by ways of a lit match and what appeared to be an extensive gas leak which was strange because the school had no gas pipe lines of any such seeing as was completely solar powered The whole catastrophe killing next to a hundred children with two missing Sam had flagged it and out of interest gone deeper but he didnt have to He and his brother Dean had inspected cases on less than that Further inspection quickly showed news of half of the town suddenly turning savage and slaughtering their neighbors a crazy mist rolling into homes and across the densely forested area of town which acted as a kind of fertilizeronsteroids and the plant life basically exploded along with anyone over twentys brains Seriously their brains just leaked out through their ears and if that isnt an immediate calling card for the supernatural then I must be losing my touch thought Sam\
\
Sam gripped the brass doorknob of the front door and looked out through the small peep hole and saw what looked to be an eye looking back at him through the glass a large yellow cats eye Slowly he began to open the door slowly slowly Of course that was until he saw the giant feline and dying girl splayed out on the front porch\
\
Dean Get up here we have a situation Sams voice was laced with panic and he clenched his teeth as he eyed the cat that had picked up the girl and had begun dragging her into the living room and painstakingly lifting her up onto the threadbare couch\
\
Sam whatever it is I am sure you can handle it Besides we have a bit of a situation as you put it down here as well remember Trying to dig up dirt on King of the Underworld you know the usual Dean shoots back at his brother too annoyed with how he has been getting nothing out of the demon he has had holed up here for nearly a week now to pick up on the note of panic in Sams voice\
\
No Dean get your ass up here now There is a girl bleeding out up in the living room along with a giant albino tiger Sam was only slightly alarmed when the white tiger started to try and clean the girls wounds\
\
Is she hot Was Deans reply from the basement He meant it as a joke to niggle his brother when in truth he was already halfway up the staircase to the ground floor Dear Cass he prayed on the way up Please come there is a possibly hot chick upstairs bleeding her guts out in the living room help would be greatly appreciated Oh and also some help cracking this demon would be great my feathery friend Oh yea uh there is a great big cat here too so watch your wings Dean listened as Sam didnt reply to his crude comment and heard instead the familiar flap of Cass entering the room When Dean did arrive at the top of the landing and poked his head into the living room he saw that the girl was indeed hot if you could look past the wrong angles that the bones that werent broken beyond recognition were jutting at and the fact that she was drenched in her life blood\
\
The tiger was now circling the girls body and snapping at anyone who came too close protecting her mistress Sam tried to approach the girl in blood and was rewarded with a snap of teeth and a warning growl Dean tried next going for the slightly more violent option and tried to shoot the tiger which just made her mad and gave him a chewed up hunk of metal that had been his gun and a vicious scratch on his chest leaving his shirt in ribbons\
\
Man I really liked that shirt Dean complained He was being only a tiny bit sarcastic in his statement\
\
Cass you try An exasperated Sam exclaimed some girl was bleeding out on their couch they were zilch for answers and since Deans try Sam had conspired to sneak behind the cat and shoot it with a moose tranquilizer All he needed was a distraction that of course being the confused angel Who else\
\
Fine But Im not sure what you think that I can do This particular Panthera tigris doesnt seem to like anyone very much When both of the boys looked at the angel he just said I was there when they named the species Oblivious to the fact that he was just a distraction for Sam Castiel walked slowly towards the brunet With determination set in his jaw he extended his arm to the Panthera tigris and watched as the cat daintily sniffed his hand before letting him go towards her mistress\
\
What the hell Dean asked puzzled\
\
Maybe it just likes me better Said Cass as he got nearer to the couch He gingerly placed his fingertips against the girls head and screwed up his eyes in concentration But because there was so much damage he wouldnt be able to get it all in one go so he concentrated on the worst injuries He slowly sealed up her stomach and reconnected her intestines fixed a shattered femur bone broken collar bone and repaired the lung damage caused by eight shattered ribs The mangled fingers and destroyed stomach muscles however would have to be corrected later as Cass could barely crouch over the female without passing out\
\
The tiger watched Sam and Dean with golden eyes and hissed when one of them tried to go towards Cass as he began to withdraw his hand\
\
SNAP The girls eyes flew open and she yanked Castiels arm towards her mouth and bit into it through the skin and drew blood For a second everyone just stared in what was an I did not see that coming look but that was long enough for the bloodied girl to start shooting out white sparks\
\
With such a weird development Sam and Deans hunter portion of their brains rapidly began to shoot off what this girl might be and how to kill her Their first thought was vampire but the white sparks somewhat puzzled the two They made a move towards the girl and the angel she was latched onto but the tiger quickly stepped between the two of them and nearly bit off the whole entity of Deans hand\
\
A cocoon of white enveloped the girl and everyone watched in amazement as it sank into her injured body once again rendering her skin without marks When the white shattered and changed to clear sand that now dusted the couch and scratched up wooden floors the girl released Castiels arm\
\
Leigheas heal She muttered and Cass bleeding arm closed back up the veins and skin restored Sorry bout that sweetheart She spoke directly to Cass as she sat up clothes still drenched but her body restored I could have fixed myself up but I needed a little help getting started Her hazel eyes swept across the room and fixed on the tiger and two boys struggling to get closer\
\
Ferria There was steel in the girls voice as she stood and beckoned to the white tiger Lig iadsan do t\'e9igh thar Let them pass by The words of the language she spoke to her tiger were harsh and guttural and made her seem exotic and powerful The white tiger growled again as if annoyed and then heaved itself up onto the couch pushing off the girl and making Cass take a step back Confusion is now anticipated feel free to panic and run screaming your head off Said the girl blandly while examining her on inspection long nails\
\
Yea well this kind of thing happens more than youd think Replied Dean with a girly roll of his eyes\
\
At this the girls eyes rise from her nails and she regarded the occupants in the room with more than indifference and turned to the big cat Ferria sibh tabhair leat mise do an Winchesters Tuigim anois Ferria you brought me to the Winchesters I understand now\
\
Ferria gives a harrumph at this as if she cant believe that her mistress would even ask her such a stupid question\
\
Sorry but can someone explain what is going on here and why she just bit me Castiels face contorts into confusion making his blue eyes squint up\
\
Oh introductions How rude of me my name is Tigress and this is Ferria And you are Dean and Sam Winchester with your trusty companion Castiel Angel of the Lord Tigress took an over dramatic bow with a sarcastic grin that rivaled even Deans\
\
Dont you get tired of being recognized all the time Castiel slyly asked the two brothers his statement held a lot of truth nobody who was anybody didnt know who they were It is definitely putting us at a disadvantage Finished Cass\
\
Shut up Cass Said both Sam and Dean in unison\
\
Well go ahead and do your tests so I can go up and get a shower Snap to it Come on it is in no way comfortable to be stuck wearing this much dried blood Tigress began to comb through her ragged rats nest of long hair while she waited for the boys to snap to it\
\
After about half a dozen tests and half an hour later all of the hot water was used up and Tigress had claimed herself a room upstairs and gotten Castiel to go out and buy her some new clothes How she managed to convince an angel of the Lord that he should do this very tedious task for someone who had just thirty minutes before taken a chunk out of his arm nobody could tell you Deans personal theory was that Cass didnt know what she was and until he did then he would be polite and pretend that he did not detest buying womens clothes at one of the nearby shops\
\
Coming downstairs in a black tee and jeans that Tigress had given Cass very specific directions on how to get with the addition of a pair of extremely cute big black boots and brushed hair Tigress was the image of someone who if the supernatural hadnt interfered in their lives could have been extremely successful Unfortunately there were just too many examples of that in life thought Sam sadly from his position at the kitchen table where he hadnt really moved since Tigress dramatic entrance\
\
Tigress walked towards the fridge and found beer about four slices of presliced all American cheese and one lone packet of forlorn frozen vegetables that sat pushed into the back of the refrigerator since probably the beginning of time\
\
Really Is this all the food you have in the house Tigress asked in disbelief she herself wasnt adverse to the idea of road food but seriously This is what they survived on stale cheese and booze\
\
Yea thats pretty much it Sam replied from where he wasnt really paying attention and was trying to figure out the connection between the Lafayette disasters So far Nothing had sparked his attention and the failure was starting to get to him\
\
Im going out to eat See you in an hour Tigress abruptly stated before calling for Ferria and walking towards the door Instead of the giant white tiger a small black and white house cat came down the steps and jumped up onto Tigress shoulder\
\
Whoa whoa whoa You cant leave Sam jumped up from his seat his knees knocking into the table and jolting his beer and computer hazardously close together\
\
And why is that Tigress replied a hint of anger in her voice She did not like to be told what to do\
\
Uh because Sam hadnt really thought that far ahead he just knew that Dean would be pissed if he found out that Tigress and Ferria were gone Okay so maybe not if Ferria was gone Sam was pretty sure that Ferria put Dean on edge for some weird reason and that he wouldnt mind seeing her eaten\
\
Because you might try and make a run for it Dean finished for Sam which bugged Sam and gave Dean the satisfaction of having the last word\
\
Im not going to fly the coop honey I have business here She said over her shoulder as she walked out of the door with Ferria who gave Dean what looked like a smirk before the two were out of sight\
\
I hope that cat gets eaten by a windigo Muttered Dean angrily he really hated that cat Wait hadnt that cat been a full sized white tiger just a little while ago Damn shape shifters he thought irritably Sam Dean began but Sam finished for him\
\
We need to figure out what she is and if we need to kill her I know Dean You do that and Ill keep at this all right Also see if you can get Cass to find anything out about her Sam said quickly he didnt like the idea of just killing Tigress because they were scared of what she was and he didnt particularly mind her company but Dean he knew wouldnt stand for her It already bothered him that she just walked around like it was no big deal and that they had known each other for years\
\
Alright we also need to set up some kind of surveillance in order to keep tabs on her could you see if you could do that too later on Dean asked his brother uneasy with Tigress presence in the house she put Cass on edge And also Cass doesnt just go shopping so Dean could say that he felt fairly anxious about Tigress\
\
Dean was on his way downstairs to look for books again when Sam yelled Absolutely no surveillance in her bedroom\
\
Oh ha ha ha Said Dean sardonically ignoring the fact that he may or may not have been thinking about doing just that\
\
\
\
In a space between dimensions Castiel angel of the Lord invisibly examined the healed skin where teeth had punctured and bled him Something was up with this Tigress and he intended to find out what and why the boys were acting so strangely calm True they were thinking about how to kill Tigress and what her connection to Ferria was but still there was no sudden adrenaline and Tigress wasnt dead or even tied to a chair in the basement with the demon\
\
Something is wrong here\
\
Something is\
\
Very\
\
Very\
\
Wrong\
Something about hunting deep within the forest alone with only Ferria calmed Tigress All of the stress of trying to keep Sam and Deans minds still and relaxed used a lot of her energy and it felt good to let go of their brains for if only a short while\
\
Tigress didnt particularly enjoy keeping them under but hey it kept her alive and well She wasnt going to hurt them and they couldnt hurt her But they wouldnt understand that Shoot first ask questions later that was the motto when dealing with the supernatural Tigress knew from the gossip that was circling the back alleys and dark markets of the nonhumans that these boys were not to be trifled with and sooner or later they would figure out something was wrong\
\
Or that damn angel would tell them She could practically feel the turmoil that her appearance had caused in his mind Oh but his mind was glorious So many secrets and what passion he held for being a member of such a cold species The sheer possibility of who he thought he was and what he believed in made him awesome and an irregularity But underneath the good intentions Tigress could feel a murky undercurrent of someone elses thoughts The kind that only get there when a mind is invaded by a creature who has entered and exited the angels head more times than possibly safe for their sanity\
\
There was a snap of twigs to Tigress left and she turned around to see a plump rabbit messing around with where she had left most of her clothes It sniffed the boots and socks before turning towards the shirt and jeans The reason for the absence of apparel was that Tigress had washed out the clothes that could be repaired in the shower and worn her tight black camisole and dark leggings under the newer attire walking to the edge of the forest before stripping off her second layer and shoes she didnt need them Her feet were so calloused that she could walk across hot coals and not feel anything so soft forest ground was no problem\
\
Looking at the unsuspecting rabbit Tigress watched as Ferria began to sneak up on it from downwind Her companion had turned back into a tiger and was stalking it as a muddy mess in order to hide her white fur and mask some of her scent with the smells of the forest duff When the time was right Tigress let out a loud click with her tongue and the rabbits head immediately swiveled around towards the sound and Ferria pounced The snap of bones and the sharp smell of life blood jolted Tigress and from her fingers came sharp gold claws about the same size as the proximal interphalangeal joint of each finger proportioning the weight perfectly She approached Ferria and took the rabbit from her jaws The two of them observed them for a moment before Tigress skinned the cat in one swipe and kept everything but the skull and feet those were given to Ferria she enjoyed the crunchiness of bones she sat with her back to a tree and ate the flesh raw\
\
Ferria sulked back into the undergrowth in search of something larger that she could eat by herself Blood soaked her muzzle and her whiskers twitched in the wind lifting her nose to inhale more air she wondered at why on Earth she hadnt been allowed to share the large lightbird that Tigress had gotten to feed on A growl began in her belly when she took stock of Tigress feelings not unlike that of a witchs familiar Tigress and Ferria could feel a great range of each others emotions and thoughts the most disturbing of the opinions were on their mission But caution about the lightbird was also strong in her mind The amount of composed and peaceful thinking she could project into peoples minds was limited and pesky lightbirds had stronger more rigid lines of the mind So trying to keep their feathers unruffled was like diverting the ocean into a stream\
\
Ferria froze as a doe poked its head outside of the protection of a bush One large paw in front of another she kept her tail low and then froze for a second as she learned the name for the lightbirds angels I like lightbird better humans come up with such stupid ways to say things Thought Ferria with a harrumph that caused the does ears to flick around and then relax once again Two steps more and Ferria leapt\
\
Tigress shivered as she felt Ferria kill the doe the satisfaction of the successful hunt filled both of them From where she sat the sun fell in comfortable dapple patterns across her pale skin which left Tigress feeling warm and comfortable and her eyes began to close Ill sit here for just a minute She thought sleepily just one minute\
\
Ferria came back full and clean and saw her Tigress sound asleep Ferria nodded her head in approval sleep is always good anywhere anytime So the white tiger curled up next to her and began to doze off slowly until both of them had both fallen into an exhausted sleep\
\
\
\
Emotion is a willy slippery thing It grips the brain and strangles all rationll thoughts When emotion is controlled and understood suddenly the mind is wiped blank A clean slate But if you add emotions together insert thoughts the way one thinks is altered Thoughts and feelings can be placed to change any person demon angel or creature\
\
This is what Tigress does Her mind reaches out to touch others sometimes without even meaning to And it hurts To feel all of the slanders anger and evils within hundreds of minds at once the pain is excruciating Blank slate minds however are calm and those are the minds that require the least energy to be around Crowds Forget it the mass of heads overwhelms the psychic line between themselves and Tigress\
\
She typed quickly and without pause her fingers were near numb and her head spun with ideas that could only be expressed through the keys of her typewriter A wisp of hair rolled into her face and she blew it away with only mild annoyance but the hair only persisted to fall in her face\
\
Ameena Are you still typing on that stupid typewriter Her sister yelled from the kitchen of their one story home\
\
Yes Came Ameenas monosyllabic reply her fingers still typing and her eyes still glued to her work She needed to type she needed to finish her story The blood in her veins began to pump faster and faster her pulse rocketed and then she was done The typewriting cheerily dinged one more time before she pulled out the story she had been working on titled Tigress Ameena walked out of her room and went to look for food\
\
The paper began to glow and spit as the ink boiled on the page Slowly the words lifted up and off of the pages and escaped out of the room by ways of the air conditioning unit off to the left of the type writer And then the pages sat empty until new ink resurfaced through the paper just in time for Ameena returning with a bar of chocolate and a glass of milk She sat down and once again began to type on the antique typewriter\
\
\
\
Tigress awoke in the sunny embrace of a what the hell Why am I in a basement She thought with anger she didnt get tied up in a basement unless she wanted to be tied up in a basement Especially not in a damp uncomfortable basement tied up with silver chains in the middle of what had to be a demon trap\
\
So not the Winchesters basement Tigress concluded her eyes scanning the room I would be able to feel their energy if they had been here in the last couple of days or so which they definitely havent Maybe Ferri Tigress thoughts screeched to a halt and she looked around wildly where was Ferria Adrenaline pounded through her veins sharpening her eyesight smell and hearing Nobody was in the room now but Tigress could hear hushed voices coming from above her head\
\
What are we going to do Just keep her in this poor bastards basement until we figure out what she is The voice was gruff and muffled but Tigress could still hear him if she concentrated\
\
Another voice sounded and Tigress held as still as possible so she could hear the faint strains of another deep voice Do what you do best and make her talk\
\
And why would I do that for you The last time I did something for your sorry ass I ended up with a lot of dead angels and tons of bloody leviathans And dont go saying If you do not assist me I will ask insert name here to do the job instead Because the only reason youre askin me mate is because youve run out of options and nobody else wants to do your dirty work So put something on the table or Im walking and you can deal with this mess\
\
What do you want The deeper voice speaks again and even from her position in the basement Tigress can hear the annoyance in his voice\
\
I want The first voice drops off as he becomes quieter and out of Tigress hearing\
\
Seconds pass and then Tigress feels a slight drop in air density around her The scent of another person hits her nose before her eyes get the message\
\
From in front of her appeared a man in a tailored suit and holding a bucket of what smelled to Tigress like holy water He grinned from just outside of the devils trap and tossed it on her and Tigress let out a blood curdling scream of pain\
\
He was still grinning when she sat up quickly and said Just kidding\
\
The grin dropped off of his face and he sighed thinking about how that just made things slightly more difficult in identifying the species of the girl in front of him\
\
What are you He was the gruff one that she had heard upstairs But now face to face she could hear his Scottish accent\
\
It depends Tigress was at the top of her game and excited This is where she was at her best inside enemy headquarters and fishing out secrets from their heads But Tigress always loving a challenge refrained from pillaging his mind She instead opted to try and obtain information through the more traditional way talking What do you want me to be\
\
Shapeshifter The whipped out a silver knife and scratched out part of the devils trap before pressing it against her arm preparing to make the cut She looked up at him and let her eyes shift into bright yellow cat eyes not unlike Ferrias\
\
Airgeadaithe d\'f3ighSilver burn She hissed under her breath still staring intensely at the man in front of her The knife erupted into flames and exploded within seconds imbedding the mans body with tiny shards of the silver knife\
\
Was the really necessary You just shredded my jacket honestly there is just no respect for fashion anymore He admonished while brushing himself down uselessly\
\
He reached for something behind Tigress and accidentally brushed their skin together\
\
Tigress flinched in pain\
\
What was that He leaned back and stared at her\
\
Tigress didnt reply simply gave him a look Her mind turning with a sudden onslaught of something she hadnt felt in a long time fear\
\
Lets see what did I do This He grabbed a hold of her arm and squeezed\
\
Pain ripped through Tigress mind and she shrieked Her brain was being torn to bits by the mans essence\
\
He released her arm and stood there the grin slowly returning to his face as he watched his handiwork Wow that was just pleasant Want to do it again He cried with mock happiness in reality he was kind of confused with her reaction It was as if the whole of her being simply rejected him\
\
Tigress just sat there panting sweat dripping down her forehead The things in that mans head hurt like most nothing she had ever felt before He is going to do it again She realized there was nothing she could do about it And this feeling of helplessness made her very very angry And her anger cut through the pain and formed an idea\
\
He reached for her pale arm and stroked the delicate skin on the underside leaving a train of red irritated skin\
\
Against her will Tigress whimpered This made her livid NO She yelled in her head No This is not how it will be not again\
\
The man gripped both of her shoulders and Tigress head nearly exploded with pain She didnt try and put walls up against the pain because the man had opened a door to his mind without even knowing it Her conscience tumbled into his mind and began ripping out the neat and orderly file cabinets of memory\
\
The man watched not sure of what was happening but feeling an intense hammering inside his head Tears streamed down the face of the girl in front of him not tears of pain but of sadness The things inside of his head hurt and were so utterly terrible that it brought her to tears\
\
He let go of her shoulders and her eyes rolled into the back of her head for a moment She sat up again and smiled at him\
\
Crowley She stated it like a fact on a piece of paper boring normal not at all like she was supposed to when addressing the king of hell This was not at all endearing to Crowley he should be shown respect Or so help him he would show this little chit who was to be feared\
\
Oh good I see youve heard of me Despite his irritation he was mildly pleased that a creature previously beyond his expertise would know of him\
\
I know a lot about you Crowley more than a lot actually Probably close to everything Because you see when you open a door it may be stepped through in either direction And I know you Crowley I know you better than you know yourself She paused for a moment before giving him a smirk Honestly though I would have thought that you would pick something I dont know less vain No you are incredibly vain so I guess it fits but really double digits for your soul Tigress rolled her eyes at him Honey please fix your priorities because you are just a bit pathetic\
\
Surprised and provoked Crowley had a problem Besides the Winchesters and his dead son nobody nobody knew about that So this left two options one the girl was in league with the Winchesters unlikely but plausible she would be attractive enough for them to look over the fact that she wasnt human Or two she was some sort of mind reader Crowley could read minds but unfortunately that gift was mostly quarantined to humans Not strange cat creatures who whispered magic words and things happened Almost like a witch but with her own power source There was something else something that he was missing\
\
He made a gesture with his hand and the chains around her disappeared She didnt move her muscles stayed locked in the same position they had been in before the chains like the chains had never left and were still there\
\
Get up He broke and used his own power He picked her up and flung her against a slimy stone wall She didnt move He lifted her up again and waited for her to struggle for air She didnt and this aggravated him somewhat more than it should have\
\
Tigress used the last of her breath to spit out N\'edlNo\
\
The hold Crowley had previously had on Tigress shattered like a thin pane of glass and she was free\
\
Idiot Tigress spat along with a small amount of blood\
\
The only reason she hadnt broken the chains was because she had wanted to see if she could learn anything more about Crowley Well that and the small part about how she had no control over her magic or body when he had invaded her mind by touching her As long as I dont let him get near me Ill be fine He may have had practice but he relies on the fact that his power has grown with age Unfortunately for him I am much much older\
\
Her breathing steadied and her eyelids fluttered as she fought to contain ragged anger CeangailConstrict Her magic colored the air and white fogged around Crowley trapping him Meanwhile a demons trap began to etch itself on the flagstones on the floor the trap was so deep the concrete foundation was visible\
\
Tigress took a wobbly step backwards and retracted her magic from the air it flooded back into her with a happy sigh She took a step towards the trapped not to mention incensed demon king passing the protective lines in the floor\
\
Something was lodged in Crowleys throat making it hard to swallow Incredibly hard He began to choke blood bubbled from his lips and he fell to his knees clutching his throat Her smile was scary and if he wasnt so prideful he would cower in the corner\
\
Seasamh Crowley Stand Crowley His knees straightened and blood continued to spew from his mouth and the world began to go dark\
\
Tigress twitched her neck in a sharp motion and he could breathe again but the blood still dripped steadily out of his throat\
\
He knew was beat when she let him breath he was at her mercy The urge to save his own skin began to invade his brain and so as she approached him his breathing quickened fear She took another step towards him they stood facing each other with less than six inches of space between the two\
\
Tagtha olc fuil Come demon blood She grabbed his tie and forcefully pulled him towards her and their lips touched\
Blood flowed from his lips to her throat and her strength over him grew She swapped wires inside of his head like a nineteen seventies telephone switch board This was his punishment he would love her If he didnt see her eventually the attraction would fade but every time he looked upon her the bond would strengthen Tigress adrenaline is what kept her in his head she was running on fumes and anger But she had no choice if she thought about what she was doing then she would absorb his memories as if they were her own And Hell had never looked better than through the eyes of its king Tears mixed with blood as the two stood there him awkward and unable to move her concentrated and goaloriented She used white out on some of his memories and sparked up others Almost there she encountered a wall a large black wall I have to smash through that dont I Tigress thought as she looked up at it from the depths of his head The amount of blood she was drawing from his heart began to speed up as she tried to create a door in the wall separating his humanity from hell\
\
The wall crumbled and Crowley shook violently as the memories were unleashed They had been caged and twisted for hundreds of years so when they emerged they were big black and menacing They bit and twisted into his head live savage hellhounds and could not be killed no matter how much he tried to squash them The dam had been broken and now the memories would not return from where they had been imprisoned for centuries\
\
Tigress broke the kiss and watched as the king of hell had a mental break down in front of her She felt a touch sorry for him but pushed the invasive feeling away There was nothing that she could do for him now he would wake up when he managed to stash his memories away again but by then it would be too late he will have been able to feel again even for just a few hours\
\
T\'f3g \'e9 Raise him She wearily lifted him up into the chair that she had been sitting in and let him sit slumped over in a suit covered in blood It was almost ironic how similar he looked to Tigress when she had appeared on the Winchesters doorstep Slowly Tigress slogged her way up the stairs and up to the first floor where she had heard the voices from before Her eyelids drooped and she fought to stay awake until she finished what she needed to do\
\
Faigh mise Ferria Find me Ferria She yelled in a ragged screech akin to that of a cat in pain A white flare erupted from her body and she crumpled on the cold stone floor\
\
\
\
Ferrias whole body contracted violently as she heard her mistress call and vivid memories snapped like a rubber band at her mind making her whiskers twitch Bad bad bad Ferria thought as she sprinted through the forest towards the Winchesters Nobody else would understand the connection between herself and Tigress And even though she hated to ask for help from males or just ask for help period she had been connected to Tigresses who had been Amazons and their prejudice against men had killed them all eventually\
\
This Tigress was different although her name had not yet been lost in this world Ferria knew that she had forgotten all of her past not tied to the white tiger Thousands of years worth of memories now lived in her head as her own Every Tigress before her was there they whispered and fought amongst each other which would eventually break the current Tigress until she was driven insane if she lived that long only three of them ever had\
\
When she arrived at the Winchesters she let out a worried screech to try and draw their attention Sam swished the curtain to the left before letting it fall back again Tigress mind had withdrawn her control and now someone had helpfully wiped their memories Ferria hissed annoyed before she remembered that she didnt need them to open up the door she could just destroy it So a sixhundred pound tiger attacked the old door successfully ripping it off of its hinges and tumbling into the house Taking another breath Ferria roared and the sound ripped through the house and into the basement making even the demons eyes fly open in fear She bounded into the kitchen and knocked Sam over before scratching him with golden claws After a moment she withdrew realizing that if she killed them now that she would never be able to get to Tigress on time Even though there had been many of them each death hurt times a tenfold to Ferria because they always died\

Dean was already up in the kitchen by the time Sam had recovered from the shallow claw marks across the front of his chest Ferria did what might be the cat version of an eye roll when Dean threatened her with a knife Ferria was going to need to fix their memories and it was going to be extremely painful not like how Tigress used her nimble fingers to gently move things around no this was going to have to be fast Ferria sat with her tail curled around her paws waiting for the magic to bubble up in her blood Her heart pounded and she watched the Dean back slowly towards Sam who was going to bleed out soon thanks to Ferrias anger\
\
Ferria carefully peeled herself away from her body until she sat there beside herself and watched the workings of the mens minds With one quick jump she lunged into the nearest one and savagely tore down the cage of memories that had been pinned up and out of reach to their subconscious She then moved onto the other one before the two of them even knew what had happened they were bent crippled with pain on the floor Ferrias essence snapped back into her body once more as her shoulders sagged with tiredness she wasnt meant to use her own magic it was Tigresses that did that The bond between the two of them wasnt just because they could no it was necessary Without it the other would be stuck in a halfway point until they found another partner once again\
\
The tiger watched as Sam was the first to get a hold of himself again and try to stand He flopped over and hit his head and Ferria sighed through her nose Greatest hunters in the world and they were stopped by a damn she sniffed the air and froze when she caught the faint smell of something that stood in between the now and then Dimensions thats the human word for it Ferria thought as she sucked in another breath of air Lightbird The awareness of something watching her made the hair on the back of her neck stick up but she ignored it she would kill whatever came through the pocket dimension before it even got the chance to think it was going to die\
\
She padded over to the taller of the Winchesters and gripped his shirt and jacket collar and started to drag him over to the door\
\
The air density in the room changed and Ferria whirled around to smell the lightbird that stood between her and the other Winchester She sheathed and unsheathed her claws in annoyance and anger every second they wasted here was one more that Tigress was in pain She opened her jaws and dropped Sam Ferria relaxed her muscles until they felt liquid and for the second time in a day she separated herself and was able to fully see the angels form and intentions She lunged at him and came away with feathers that fluttered and changed to black dust before they fell towards the ground\
\
If you stop me Ill kill you I need their help and this is your fault Ferria spoke in the ephireal plane to the angel who quickly became very still Her voice rumbled through his head and hurt his mind like a loud crack of thunder The tiger flickered and her starlight image began to dull Tigress didnt have much time left and Ferria could feel it she was already draining herself trying to keep her alive\
\
Ferria once again wavered and shook as her form began to break down desperate she made a deal that she had never had to make before This Tigress was special she was written in the prophesies of the past and could not die just yet No she had work to do\
\
Ill tell you\
\
The angel didnt need to ask to know what Ferria was talking about she would tell him what he wanted to know provided he save her counterpart\
\
He could do that\
Blood flowed from his lips to her throat and her strength over him grew She swapped wires inside of his head like a nineteen seventies telephone switch board This was his punishment he would love her If he didn adrenaline is what kept her in his head she was running on fumes and anger But she had no choice if she thought about what she was doing then she would absorb his memories as if they were her own And Hell had never looked better than through the eyes of its king Tears mixed with blood as the two stood there him awkward and unable to move her concentrated and goaloriented She used white out on some of his memories and sparked up others Almost there she encountered a wall a large black wall t I worth of memories now lived in her head as her own Every Tigress before her was there they whispered and fought amongst each other which would eventually break the current Tigress until she was driven insane mind had withdrawn her control and now someone had helpfully wiped their memories Ferria hissed annoyed before she remembered that she didns eyes fly open in fear She bounded into the kitchen and knocked Sam over before scratching him with golden claws After a moment she withdrew realizing that if she killed them now that she would never be able to get to Tigress on time Even though there had been many of them each death hurt times a tenfold to Ferria because they always died\

\

\
He could do that\
\
\
\
Say what you want about good intentions but they only really exist to be manipulated by others Castiel wasnt have to plot anymore It wasns presence\
\
He refused to call them by the names they gave themselves he knew that Ferria was in fact the name of the tiger but the girlt really Tigress Castiel would not call her something that she was not As he jumped between locations he continued to think about his troubles He stumbled slightly when he landed almost on top of the girl who had somehow managed to crawl up the stairs and collapse on the landing He wondered alarm began to make the hairs on the back of his neck and arm a human reflex to predators and danger A strange feeling clawed at the inside of his stomach like a rabid animal trying to escape out through his throat Thought Castiel matching his feeling to that of figurative language a new skill taught to him by his time hanging out with demons\
\
He asked pointlessly his face angled down at Tigress Remembering the first time they met he kept his distance No biting this time\
\
It suddenly occurred to him that Crowley wasn where was he Cautiously he did the angel equivalent of down the stairs which mostly entailed him stomping down into the basement without any thought to the amount of noise he was making He was an Angel of the Lord for Godt need to learn how to no matter what Dean told him It was then he saw the king of Hell slumped in the silver chair completely delirious and racked with shivers With a quizzical tilt of his head Castiel kneeled down and touched the demonShe Castiel realized as he watched her closely he knew that he was just an observer in this memory but her frantic energy was making his chest close up as the rat in his stomach died\
\
She let out a blood curdling scream as he hit the cage once more before slumping defeated against the far corner of the cage Castiel moved out of the way even though he knew that she wouldns eyes\
\
He froze afraid for a moment that she could see him See him not helping her see him just standing there because he knew that this moment was in the past and that he couldnI can see yous memories like this It should be impossible but here she was speaking to him What was he supposed to say\
\
t be able toI know that you don She told him her brow drawn together as she looked at him t be here this isn She said dismissively which against his better judgments angers Castiel\
\
The anger he tried to keep out of his voice leaks in despite his best efforts\
\
She hissed at him getting closer and pushing him roughly against the cage She seethed and accentuated every sentence with a wellplaced shove to his chest\
\
others CastielThey Her eyes flicked for a moment with sadness She bit her lip and took a breath t be quite so polite and may possibly rip your angelic mind from your body which they will then proceed to torture here as a past time Much like your wonderful relations Michael and Lucifer what a piece of work those two were A smile pulled at her lips before she looked back up at him with a seriousness in her voice\
\
Confident of his power over these other simple mindechos Castiel was wrongly unafraid of the other occupants of TigressI am the first Tigress beginner of the Pantheras Dynasty conqueror of the Alician Forest and commander of the court of Fire What is your nameMy title is Castiel Angel of the Lord and day of Thursday of the regime He was interrupted by a smaller woman\
\
She spoke to Cass but shot a glare at the first woman\
\
Yelled Assenturaus indignantly her eyes narrowed and brow drew together to reap his soul and keep his mindThirtieth TigressShame on both of you Arguing over protecting the current Tigress Having said her piece the thirtieth Tigress stepped back into the crowd\
\
A darkskinned woman with gold swirls under her skin announced herself as\
\
Castiel was beginning to understand the way the women thought and nodded before speaking\
\
The darkskinned one stomped her foot and white magic shot out from around her enveloping CastielWhile you are in this mind there shall be no language barrier and you will understand things as the owner of the memories did at the time faded into the steam as he was suddenly plunged into the darkness of somewhere he should not be\
\
And may never escape from\
Castiel stood in the bedroom of a little girl Her mousey brown hair was spread out disorderly on her pillow as she smiled happily at the ceiling of her room where she had tacked a poster Her eyes were wide with thought what she was thinking was unknown to the angel standing watch beside her bed as Tigress mind was better protected then most peoples Her thoughts didnt simply project themselves onto his consciousness no they stayed hidden\
\
A hand touched his shoulder and Cass whirled around to see the first EchoTigress he had met the one in the rusty metal cage\
\
Hello again sweetheart She said with a smirk Did you miss me\
\
Youre back Asked Castiel ignoring her question pointedly\
\
Of course this is my mind youre running through I basically here to make sure you dont damage it My sisters were explicit when they said you needed watching so who wants to take that job Let me tell you Assenturaus really wanted to be the one to do that but I made the case that it was my body so I should Her lighthearted tone dropped from her voice and she stared into his eyes Youre one lucky bastard AngelMan they should have torn you to pieces you know Weve face much worse than the likes of the kind in your world The taunting smile was back You ever met an adlet\
\
Castiel furrowed his brow why were they talking about adlets\
\
Giving him a grin she said Didnt think so theyre a damn piece of work but back to the past Im here to explain whats going on around you and to babysit you We all know what kind of nasty little things that one can do while inside someones mind She cocked her head Dont we Naomi\
\
Pardon Castiel looked at her in confusion\
\
Never mind just watch She told him sharply crossing her arms protectively over her stomach\
\
The little girls eyes fluttered closed as she began to fall asleep Suddenly her eyes flew open and she began to breathe hard\
\
Hello She called her girly voice quivering in fear\
\
A sigh came from the direction of the shadows You shouldnt be able to tell that Im here\
\
The little girls eyes went wide and her shoulders started to shake violently I can pretend that youre not She suggested in a whisper\
\
A chuckle sounded from the shadows Castiel found his feet were rooted to the ground He desperately wanted to know who or what was speaking but one look from the EchoTigress told him that he was going to just have to suck it up and wait for everything to play out the way it had many years ago\
\
You do that but it wont change that Im here The voice was deep and gravely and familiar\
\
Why are you here She asked the shadows politely her voice had stopped shaking but her hands were white knuckling the edge of her purple comforter\
\
I dont know darling The voice sighed again I just am it wasnt my choice you know All I was told was to watch you for something\
\
And whats that That something She questioned with that kind of young confidence the kind you have because you are still too little to know that certain things are dangerous\
\
Trust me love if I knew I wouldnt be here\
\
Well Ill let you know if I see anything okay Mister The girl told the shadows trust evident in her big eyes\
\
You do that darling The voice said quietly\
\
The girl waited for a few moments before saying Why do you sound so sad You shouldnt be sad there is so much happy in the world Just look at my room at my poster Isnt it pretty\
\
The voice was silent for a minute Its a very nice poster love You put it up there all by yourself\
\
Yup There was immense pride in the little girls voice and a genuine smile lit up her small face\
\
Well thats quite an achievement Do you thi The shadows voice was cut off abruptly when a flash of white lit up the room blinding everybody momentarily The white exploded into millions of grains of clear sand the sand then began to move to form the barest outline of an oval on the wooden floor It changed from white to a deep blue before it started to rotate incredibly quickly Within the space of a few seconds a hole to somewhere else opened up in the floor\
\
Two sets of human arms reached up through the blue and grasped the edge of the floor pulling themselves up into the room The portal kept swirling as the beings revealed themselves to be an eerily attractive woman and another with ragged brown hair and a creamy complexion The attractive one looked at the little girl and her face soured dramatically almost an improvement over the scowl that had been there before\
\
Damn Said the brown haired one Let me guess wrong dimension I always get that wrong past present future parallel universe blah blah blah She rolled her eyes and shot a look at her companion Sorry Winter\
\
Winter continued to frown as the other woman took stock of the appearance of her reflection in the small child sized mirror in the little girls room Hmm Seriously not acceptable portal travel is unpredictable and after years of practice I still always manage to end up with a bad hairdo and seriously She turned her head and saw a patch of black hair mixed in with her brown Damn it Winter sorry but uh I think we swapped some hair She said sheepishly\
\
Winter said nothing in return just stared blankly at the wall The scowl had disappeared instead there was just immense grief\
\
The other woman turned around and saw Winters expression sadness filled her eye Give me a second and Ill have that fixed rud a mhalart\'fa agus socraigh A white mist surrounded the two women not unlike the way Tigress had healed herself when Castiel had first met her\
\
Both womens appearances had been much improved and there was no longer any black in the other womans hair The woman with the magic shot a sideways glance at Winter before muttering to herself Thanks Tigress I couldnt have even thought about doing this trip without you She imitated what must have been Winters voice You are my hero helping me try and find one specific timeline amongst millions something even Elora thought I was crazy to try With a snort she kept speaking No of course not after all all were trying to do it pull out the life thread of your one true love and divert it down a different course of reality where he wont have died from a knife in his back Easy peasy why didnt I think of it before\
\
Who are you Asked the shadows the voice had lost all of the kindness that it had displayed earlier towards the little girl\
\
Be gone Said Winter harshly before emitting a low pitched growl With a snap the being in the shadows was pulled from the room\
\
It was the first time that Winter had spoken and her voice just dripped with unearthly sound making you want to do whatever she said\
\
You shouldnt be so mean Said the little girl from where her head was just barely peeking out from under the comforter\
\
And why is that Asked Winter her voice bitter making the little girl flinch Even though the immense power previously displayed towards the being in the shadows had disappeared her voice was still highly compelling\
\
Because he was nice and youre not The little girl said haughtily\
\
The other woman apparently Tigress also this just kept getting more and more confusing for Castiel let out a snort and stifled some giggles You tell her little one you go ahead and tell off a bloody siren capable of making your throat close up with a single note of her song\
\
A siren She isnt a siren Castiel hissed at the EchoTigress who looked at him reproachfully before responding\
\
She is a siren just not like the ones from this world Where Winter comes from things are different Her voice was hushed and soft as if she was scared of interrupting the scene unfolding in front of her\
\
She wouldnt do that though would she Make me stop breathing I mean Asked the little girl with wide panicked eyes\
\
Without even a second thought OtherTigressfromtheportal told her with a smirk she paused to look at the dimming light emerging from the portal A frown covered her mocking smile as she watched the sand begin to slow down Winter we need to leave Concentrate okay OtherTigress voice gave away the fact that she was worried for her companion who was still staring emotionlessly at the wall\
\
Winter said nothing in response only stood still watching something that nobody else could see\
\
OtherTigress bit her lip and gently corralled Winter towards the portal Lets go OtherTigress turned towards the little girl who was still watching dumbstruck and gave her a wide grin like the Cheshire cat and a salute before falling backwards into the writhing pulsing portal\
\
The scene froze and Castiel turned around to see EchoTigress holding a remote control with her finger on the pause button\
\
What She asked defensively Its my head I can do whatever I want\
\
I thought that you were just an echo of Tigress head Stated Cass so confused that he even used the name she had given herself Trying to sort through the little information he had Cass realized that he had first met this EchoTigress in what he had perceived as a memory but maybe that was the actual Tigress Her being her actual person might be different in her head than outside of it\
\
MaybeEchoTigress let out a snort Whos head did you think you were in sunshine Im what Tigress is like in her head her real personality and mind is me The tangible one you talk to normally Shes a projection of me which is actually really confusing when I think about it Okay so imagine a filter right Wait no dont do that it just makes this even more difficult to understand Give me a second EchoTigress thought for a moment taking in the puzzled look on Castiels face while struggling to find a way to explain Basically Im Tigress but without all of the emotions and scars Does that make any sense whatsoever\
\
Castiel shook his head slightly still trying to figure it out himself\
\
Fine you know what Well just skip to the next bit off to the future past or whatever\
\
The scene shimmered and shifted to a dark alleyway the thump of club music penetrated the mildew covered side street Castiel narrowed his eyes at the smell urine and rot EchoTigress breathing quickened and her eyes nervously darted back and forth before finally landing on a woman She looked a lot like a combination of the small child Castiel had seen moments before and the EchoTigress standing next to him The woman stomped onto the cobblestones her arms the only protection against the cold Her shorts so high up her ass Castiel fought the urge to blush he wasnt embarrassed by nudity just didnt like looking when they didnt know he was there She adjusted her shirt so it covered as much of her body as possible A biting wind whistled its way through the alleyway and she swore\
\
Stupid stupid stupid why couldnt I just get a normal job like everybody else She kicked at a stone in her heels and swore some more when her toe began to throb Its not as if any other job would pay enough to cover the tuition but how on earth did She promptly shut her mouth when she heard a car pull up at the other end of the alley\
\
The woman swore again and fumbled around in her purse she retrieved a can of pepper spray only to drop it on the ground and have it roll into an open sewage grate\
\
The car door opened and a man got out Hey babe I help with anythin Maybe give ya a ride home\
\
The woman smiled and replied No thank you I live just up here She vaguely gestured towards the end of the alleyway\
\
The man chuckled and said Naw babe nothin round here but industrial lockers and concrete slabs He took a step forward and the woman swallowed caught in her lie Youre that chick from the strip club aint ya The one who did blue glitter and sand What ya doin all out in the dark here A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth Miss your cab\
\
The woman scanned the buildings around her looking for a way to end the conversation She glanced down at his feet sturdy working boots there was no way she could out run him She caught a glimpse of the shiny metallic surface of the pepper spray as it bobbed up and down in what she didnt wish to imagine\
\
The man took a step closer and EchoTigress ground her teeth in agitation her hands curled into fists\
\
The woman in the alley stepped to the side just enough to be able to reach her pepper spray if she reached down\
\
Hey babe no need to be fraid The man abandoned his slow stepping routine and walked towards her almost casually Just want some dance time didnt get to have you alone at the club\
\
The woman gave another tightlipped smile Sorry but I only do that business at the club any other place and I go back to my day job\
\
By this point the woman was full out panicking and grasping blindly for her pepper spray as it bobbed happily just out of reach The man quickly snatched her up from the ground using the back of her tube top it ripped and left her in nothing but her shorts and bra\
\
The woman gasped in shock as the cold air hit her bare skin and then was pushed to her knees by the man as he held her by her hair\
\
She did the only thing she could do and pulled his arm down to her mouth with both hands and bit down Blood spurted from his wrist when her teeth ripped open one of his arteries His eyes flared wide and he raised a hand to hit her when a snapping noise came from the opposite end of the street His head swiveled over to where the sound had originated only to get tackled by the white tiger Ferria\
\
The tiger ripped him to shreds as a the PortalTigress emerged from the shadows She kneeled down beside the fallen woman who was curled into fetal position The PortalTigress grasped her hair and tugged it gently to get her to look up the womans eyes widened in disbelief\
\
You She said Youre her from that night With that other woman Winter\
\
PortalTigress shrugged then took off her coat and handed it to the woman on the ground The woman stood and PortalTigress handed her a shimmering knife that seemed to glow in the darkness She leaned in close and whispered into the womans ear for a moment before standing back\
\
The womans eyes became glassy and her head cocked and as raised the blade once before piercing PortalTigress in the heart\
