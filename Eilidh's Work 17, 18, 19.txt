Sunflowers
Yeah sunflowers 
They gave me hope for a new days come
Yeah sunflower s 
They gave me thoughts of love

I grew great birds  raised them in my backyard
Diet of bugs and blackberry leaves
I fed them so theyd grow up vicious  but still want to curl up in my arms
Yeah  sunflowers  like the birds  they grew tall

I fought with sunflowersortofhate
I let my emotion get the best of me
But my birds feel no regret for the things theyve ate
They were heartless  and they only felt a lust for survive

Yeah sunflowers 
I knitted them together into a crown
Say that the sunflowers  they follow the light
And theyll show you the way back home again

Ill come again  back where I was once from 
Ill get my soul back
Ill come back again to that garden  filled with sunflower forests
And my birds  amongst the thick stalks 


Fool 
I missed feeling LOVE 
	I missed feeling POWERFUL again 
	I wanted to get back what Id had  Id had it  Id had it that summer 
	I want to go back and ask so many questions 
	My God  I needed some things to be said  but instead

	Ach  youre a fool  look what youve done
	Youre a fuckin fool and youve really gone and done it now
	My LOVER would never want a man like you 
	My LOVER cant stand to even imagine being touched by you 
	Youre a fuckin fool 

	I am no mistakes made
	I am no foolish forgetful man 
	I own this skin Im in 
	I am what made me  and I am no fear 
	
Conversation on What Went Wrong
 I havent got a problem   I say   Theres nothing wrong with me  
 Youve got no troubles  no worries  
 I have what I should  I should think   I say   Perhaps you have the heartache  maybe youre the hurt one  
 What happened that year  
How blunt of him   I almost killed myself   I say 
Its really out before I can think about it 
 And howd you do that   What a morbid fascination  what a bastard  Dont pry into my life 
 Im missing these moments  the moments I shouldnt have missed  
 How are you left living a life that isnt your own  
 I dont know  I blinked and I was outta my own sorta head   I shrug   I blinked and I wasnt the same anymore  I didnt know what had happened  
 You just blinked and you just sorta missed it  
 Yes  
 What a fool you were back then  
 Yes  
 What a strange sort of man that makes you now   He said 
 Yes  

Look what we gave up for you
I was not given up on  It took me a while to realize it  that there were still people who cared for me when I could not care for myself 

Maybe  you should just come home
I could never return home againsometimes it feels as if Ive died  I needed to be someone else to survive  I say  as if that makes it okay 

Whatever you choose  make sure its for you
I dont know who I am yet  I want to say  I dont know all the facts  all the thoughts  Im unequipped  I dont know what to do I dont know how to choose 

Regardless  you must decide soon
I dont know what to do  If I can never go home again  if Im not able to ever return to that place I dont know what I can do to change 

Its okay to not know its okay to make mistakes
I am all out of mistakes  I am all out of pathway  Ive waited too long  and now I have no options  I have nothing left to offer  Im sorry I cannot give back what I took  what I borrowed 

Youve got to have faith itll all work out
I am givenup and godless now  Faith is the last thing I had  but I donated it away  I am whatever I was made to be  regardless of accidentally or purposefully 


I stopped wanting to kill Peter 
And moved on to wanting to snap the spine of another man 

It became too hard 
It was too difficult to say I love you Peter 
And mean it
So I stopped saying it

I still missed him though  I missed his warmth  his familiarity
But I rationalize it
Peter had to die 
We all do 

I stopped wanting to kill Peter 
And I think it broke my heart

What did it mean  That I allowed Peter to go free 
Does it mean Ive stopped wanting him 

I dont know what it means  Peter
Just that I hope one day Ill be forgiven
For wanting to take my bloodlust elsewhere

Ill always miss that voice sayin
Its time to kill Peter
Its time to kill him
Kill Him 
KILL PETER 

But  why cant I shake the feeling that after all that time  all those dreams of murder 
Ive killed Peter
Killed im dead nonetheless

Ive stopped wanting to kill Peter
Ive stopped wanting to kill Peter and wear his bones as a corset 
Ive stopped wanting to do what I shoulda 

I shouldve killed Peter 
I shouldve said to him I love you 
I love you Peter 
Oh Peter  It wasnt on purposeI didnt mean it 
I killed another man
A man who was not you

Oh Peter 
Ive gone and killed Peter 

What a mistake Ive made 

A Great Voice
In this night I heard a great voice say to me 
Give me something of value 
Say something you mean 

I delivered a bite to the neckand told that great voice off
Said he was a rude influence
And I would not have things like that asked of me until I made my way back home again

Back in hell
Devil looked at me with tears in his eyes and I kissed him back
Said Id give him my soul  as long as he let me back the path I had came
I had mistakes to unmake 
And so little time to unmake them 

God would want me for himself  I knew and made peace with it
God would want to take anything I had  I knew and so I stood in a ring of my own blood and begged protection from these deities 
I would not be made a servant of His agenda not again 
I would be as I always had  I would make a life free from obligation
Free of the men who would seek to eat me
Suck my tongue out through my teeth

The answer came as a breath on my cheek
If you want to be saved
Youll have to save yourself 


How I Lived
I lived in spite 
It was all I hadI had spite for myselffor all of the things I was made to do while I was unwilling  unwanting of change
I had a long  wool scarf 
And I wrapped myself in it  and curled underneath my dirty pile of clothes
My eyes were dirty and fetid
And I let myself be lost and to decay

I lived in malaise 
I would do horrible things  and let myself die before I admitted 
What I had done 
I painted my nails red  and then pressed them underneath my eyes
Willing for them to finally pop  for it all to be done 

I lived in loss 
I lost myself  I say  I wrote  I lost who I was 
I didnt know I could make it out come lightagain  
I lived as shallow specter of grief because I wasI was alone
And the old me would not come back
Even when I asked

I lived as someone else
For whole years
Until I could not anymore 

Water Spirit
I found a singing water spirit in the abandoned wood 
He promised me  a babbling brook  and endless love with endless life to live
He promised me  the findofalifetime and a lover that would remain sweet
And I said  to the water spirit   What do you want from me  
And he just shrugged   What would you give me  for all that  anyway  

It was a dark pool  adjacent to the spring  and the spirit was a man with pale blue skin looking up at me 
I had nothing to give  nothing to spare  not even the pennies I kept sewn into my heart to remind me of my commodity  and I needed the iron nails in my pockets to ward off the fairies that lived in the wood
But when I said all that  he again just shrugged and shook his head 
That wily water spirit  he gestured for me to come into his lovely little spring
The waters just right  just like you like
Come along  love  youre alright

I was divested of all will to stay by the bank  and I dove right in
My clothes dissolved like papiermâché and I fell deep in love with the fresh water taste
The water spirit  he said   Come along   and he gestured away from the shore  said  Come along   and I followed close behind
We swam for many days  and we met in an
Underwater world  what a beautiful underwaterplace
Reminds me of my lovelyboy  who Id lost some time before
Reminds me of my lovelyboy  and myohmy  his narrow blue eyes

Water spirit said wed get along just fine  said that he and I would do fine  here in underwater world and underwater heaven
There were towering buildings  towering women with long flowing hair  and towering volcanic spires
And I didnt think about that abandoned wood  or those frightening fay I tried in vain to ward away
All I thought of was where I was 
I didnt think of any redlit hellscape or any lovelyboy
I had no grief or sadlife
Because I did not think I had lost that love  I had lost those things that I had wanted so hard to keep mine 
Because instead I did a thing that meant me running away

Water spirit and I got along perfectly well  he promised me the findofalifetime  and endless love for endless life
And I got all those things  I just had to swim
I was promised the ability to wish away  all those things that made me so sad  all those things that made me feel so complicated  all those things that made it hard to love me
And so I swam  and swam and I kept on swimming  because oh my love  I had let him go
I heard the water whisper it briefly You Killed Him
You Murdered A Man Dead
Because Your Attentions Are Fleeting
You Should Be Ashamed
And  my God  I was

Water spirit  I prayed  come take me awayI dont know where youve gone  and now Im lost  its too dark down where I am now
I want to go home 

But water spirit  he was gone  hed never really been there at all
I didnt think any of it was real  I didnt think any of what I did that day was true
What great mistake have I made 
That wily water spirit man was nothing if not a reflection of me  none of what he said was a straightout lie But None Of It Was Really Quite True Though  Was It 
Or was that just the water talking again  
The heavy water in my ears  shouting 
Come Back Home 
You Cannot Sleep This One Off
You Cannot NotCare Anymore
You Must Return Home
You Do Not Belong Here 

And its scary  but I woulda died there I know
I woulda let myself get consumed by the water sunk in my bones It woulda killed me  I think 
A water spirit  be damned
I wanted to return home to that wood  and those clothes I had left dissolved  I wanted my iron and copperback secure in my fist
My GodI wanted my blood to come back  and the flush in my cheeks to return
I was tired of being dead  I was tired of being cold
And  by God  I wanted to be warm 

The MacKay Woman Who Made The Devil
It was never going to be the fault of the lovely one
It was never going to be him  letting her down  it was only ever gonna be what it wasand it was about duplication and melon colored bruises
Something sitting in the back of her throat waiting  taking its time before crawling out  and making itself knowncrawling out and making moves to swallow her whole
She was a bitch  and shed fuck you up for knowing it  and that was just FINE by her
She once made a deal with God  she promised shed mentor his dearest son what a sweet sweet boy hed been but by the time she was doneGod was angry He was mad That bad girl had pushed his son  and his son heFELL 
And when she was confronted she just laughed  said  Yes God  I did what I did  and your boy was sweet to the tasteI had him  and he was mine  and then I was done
Thats what the rumors said  anyways  thats what the townsfolk whispered  she was a MacKayWoman after all  all woman of MacKay blood had a little bitohell in them the moment they were born
That woman  shed bite her own damn head off if it meant getting the best of youand she knew it too
It was never going to be the fault of the lovely oneMacKay women did not love menand they certainly took no hand in marriage or picketfencestaking
It was never going to be Him  letting her downbecause God was deadas far as she was concerned  and that was all that mattered to her
It was going to be what it was  and it was about Pride and Revenge
And she would get what she was owed 

My Last Breath Was To Virgon
I gave my last breath to Virgon  her dream
Virgon got my last gasp of air  used it to fuel her fire
That was Virgon  here and then gone
She said that it was time to get lost  and to lose myself to flames
Virgon said  the crown had been aligned
And it was written in the stars
Its time to go home  Virgon  said Come on back to me
And let me make the rest of your life sweet

Its time to go on homeIve been so alone  
Its time to go on back  Virgon  she was calling me
And my love  Virgon  promised that shed be there
Waiting on me 

Cherry Tree

Oh my sweet lovely cherry tree
Grew just outside my childhood bedroom window
It snowed white petals in spring
And the thick carpet covered my driveway

My sweet lovely cherry tree spit cherries down on me
They were sour and bright red and mostly made of 
Cherry pit
But I loved itand buried every single seed

The only tree I could not climb  sweet cherry tree
It snowed white  and I let the petals rest on my tongue
And it tasted of the spring
And a reminder to pay attention to the things around me

That cherry tree  grew tall and spindly
Taller than any cherry tree should be
Because it was a wild cherry tree  and it would be whatever it would be
To be a cherry tree what a dream

A Summer

There was a man with blue eyes
And then the summer was over  and all of us returned back to reallife again
Except some of ussome of us did not ever go home again

The summer had ended and now it was time to grow up and have children and to give up seasonal drinking
And the summer was done and we all returned to our parents homes and awaited the return of a summer that would never come again

It was timeless  saturated in blue  red  yellow  and a brief flash of green right before the end
The summer was dead  and not all of us lived to return home again 

The fly could not love you
And it flew into the fire and then it
Burned 

I warmed my back to the fire
In nothing but a white towel
And it was all okay
And I saw it all clear and coolly

My back was to the fire
And a hand of flame reached to caress me from behind
It swept the panes of my back and carried on
Down my spine

The flame gave me the reminder I needed
To keep my head screwed on straight
And to follow my instinct

The night of Christmas Day
I was on watch
I kept my back to the flames
And the fire roared on all night long

The fly could not love you
And it flew into the fire and then it
Burned

And I was warmed
And quietly thanked it

Before returning to my bed when the fire finally died
And the sun had begun to rise

Lights
You make my heart glow  
Turn on all the little string lights hanging across my chest
Make those little things go hot and bright
So hot they cant handle the strain
Shatters and explodes
Glass cutting my face and my neck and the insides of both my thighs

This feeling is no flame
Im made of no lighter fluid
Ive never been a cigarette
But I have been a killer
The feeling is of no flame  but Ive slowroasted poetry over a candle
Burned up all the words until all was left was
Your name

I felt those waves  saw that storm before it came
Electricity  fire  and water mixed together
All my little lightbulbs fried
That candle extinguished
Its too unusual  and I dont believe you
When you tell me Im beautiful

I missed you at night  without my lights
I wondered if you would ever make it home
Kissing your face  falling into a deep pit of 
Who are you now that your words
I cant even finish that
Youve heard me cry  but never seen me without a sly grin on my face
And its on purpose 

You gave me these lights and Im doing my damndest
To pop them
And turn em out one by one
Until my insides match 
The look on my face
Ill never be good and Ill never be kind
An overly critical mess
But Im not scared
The look on your face says Im terrifying in the dark
And as a warning Ill blink once
And then Ill eat you up 

The Moth
An idle threat caused her neck to crane
 You cannot go on like this   Said the moth
Her hair  pulled by the wind  wrapped around her neck and tightened
 There is no go on when you are a dead woman   She spat back
The moth shuddered but kept on
Images of slit wrists and digging underneath her skin with a screwdriver
Trying to pry out the intruder
The moth called the woman closer
Standing on a grassy knoll and with dry lightning in the distance
But she said   Ill crush you in my palm if you come any nearer  
Her eyes flashed and her hair loosened from round her neck
And the moth was stolen way by the wind

She
You did not write as you promised to  I said to a mean girl
Shrug 
Did it ever matter  Did it ever mean anything  Writing towards a looming deadline  I saw a television show about the birds and the bees
I always hated school  she said to me
Hated the crunch  the plastic applicator
The sandwiches with not enough jelly 
All of her dreams were about swimming through air as thick as water 
She said   I got this nightmare  
Eating chocolate cake she baked from a box  all alone in her house with her bare hands
Shoveling it all in so she cant breathe and for a moment before she wakes  her throat clogged with thick chocolate cake  her vision swims and she sees God
Shes got him wrapped around her finger and only wears black leather jackets that dont fit the width her shoulders
She got that Black Eyeliner that makes her eyes look beady
And she
Only eats raisin bread and Reeses peanut butter cup ice cream
Ignores you when you talk to her
Insists she heard you the first time when you snap your fingers in front of her face to make sure shes paying attention
Trains for her life of future crime by jumping chain link fences in the dark and knows that killing doesnt bother her shrug and that ghosts only haunt people that dont know how to take care of themselves
Has no heart  feels no love  but is all the more fun because
Cannot carry a tune  but loves to sing  loudly and often
Blows kisses to the men who catcall her on the street because she likes it and doesnt see what all the fuss is about
Says to me that
Every man she meets in a gas station tells her shes  not like those other girls  and to wear less makeup even when shes not wearing any at all
Loves the color orange  owns nothing orange
Cusses like a sailor but hates boats and feels her chest being crushed and her ears ringing any time she touches water
And she
Is especially hard on the boyfriends of her friends  after having convinced herself she can see into their heads just by listening to the way they pronounce their vowels
Insists that all of her friends breakup with their significant others immediately
And she
Went and let that place get the best of her
Blames literally anything other than herself but somehow always feels guilty
Uses a lighter to burn the tips of her fingers 
Wishes more people would realize how figuredeverythingout she is and ask her for advice
Shes got both eyes peeled for pretenders and she cant stand them  afraid theyll find her out
She feels nothing and is glad
And she
Shrug
Is what she is and is what she was

She
You did not write as you promised to  I said to a mean girl
Shrug 
Did it ever matter  Did it ever mean anything  Writing towards a looming deadline  I saw a television show about the birds and the bees
I always hated school  she said to me
Hated the crunch  the plastic applicator
The sandwiches with not enough jelly 
All of her dreams were about swimming through air as thick as water 
She said  I got this nightmare  an described it to me as thus
Eating chocolate cake she baked from a box  all alone in her house with her bare hands  Shoveling it all in so she cant breathe  her throat clogged with thick chocolate cake  drowning in it
She tells me shes got him wrapped around her finger but how she cannot make a decision and she worries that she will stall out and stagnate  sink into a pond somewhere and never be found again
She only wears leather jackets that dont fit the width of her shoulders
She got that Black Eyeliner that makes her eyes look beady
And she
Only eats raisin bread and Reeses peanut butter cup ice cream
Ignores you when you talk to her
Insists she heard you the first time when you snap your fingers in front of her face to make sure shes paying attention

Cusses like a sailor but hates boats and feels her chest being crushed and her ears ringing any time she touches water
And she
Is especially hard on the boyfriends of her friends  after having convinced herself she can see into their heads just by listening to the way they pronounce their vowels
Insists that all of her friends breakup with their significant others immediately
And she
Goes an insists shes so different
Blames literally anything other than herself but somehow always feels guilty
Uses a lighter to burn the tips of her fingers 
Wishes more people would realize how figuredeverythingout she is and ask her for advice
Shes got both eyes peeled for pretenders and she cant stand them  afraid theyll find her out
She feels nothing and is glad

At The Time  

At the time  Death was not a friend
But when God abandoned me 
I dared him  cast me out
EASY  
Death appeared in mirrors and in glass windows
He hunted me in reflections 
And when I finally met his gaze he stood
Black hooded and blue eyed
And asked me what master I would live to serve 
If I kept on the way I had been 

And Death came to be regarded as a friend 
He encouraged the deadly passions
Said  YOU HAVE BECOME GOD
ABUSE IT  
Men could not be trusted to keep my secrets or to follow through with their duties
So I calmed their raised hackles and fed their guts with 
Beautiful  cherry blossoms and a great spear tipped with poison 
Spring had come
And it was seeded in their bellies 

And I  got down  underneath the sound of mortar fire 
Ducked low in the long grassdug myself down into a hole
My promise to burn the place Id been left in 
It had swallowed me whole
The seeds of revolution  came to fruition and flowered as big  thick yellow petals and a heavy  hungry red tongue 
YOU LET THEM DOWN
A smell made to twitch the stomach 
my love  laid down a circle of salt  and  my love  I could not cross it to touch youwhat had I become  
And then the heat to make me sweat at the brow
Death encouraged me to remain hungry 
And let the emptiness become me

Three AM and I rose 
Unasleep  just as I had been for days 
I HAD BECOME GOD 
And I said to Him  if he needed revenge that hed 
Best come get it himself  
oh  my love  what had I become  
oh  love  I have missed youwont you remind me of who I used to be  
But He did not arrive 
And it was only Death who came 

It is nights like this one  the cool breeze slipping in through the window
That it comes to me in flashes
Balmy  heady  nights 
A yellow crown 
And kisses 
Ahit was the lover 
My God  a jealous man 
What he took from me  unforgivable things
Unfixable things 
So it was in revenge  in retaliation 
I allowed summer to come 

Summer came with an anger that rivaled my own 
And how sure the anger felt in my belly 
How it never ended 
How it coils and twitches 
The cloying flowers of spring began to eat all of mankind 
And soon  they said they would consume God 
Their yellow petalled flowers  with red tongues lolling 
They made to swallow me whole 
But I was not done
I called for you  my love  but youd already gone away
I made a bid for blood 
I bathed in it 
And damn itI was made finally free 




Visions
Deathas an untrustable man  
By his side  she was kissing him  No  not Death  another man 
God become her  He was a beautiful man  Very handsomevery lovely  
She pulls away and there he is  Flushed and panting  and his pulse is throbbing   
FLASH 
She sees herself  Rip out his own throat 
And hes bleeding  and hes bleeding  
Theres blood  Theres so much blood 
sPRAYING and gUSHING 
all down her neck
all over her chest
slippery and wet
tasted on her teeth 
violence  The best moment of a second  Violence 
Senseless murder 
Red copper coats her eyelashes and is spattered on her face  licks her teeth
The death vision is gone 
Gone in the blink of an eye  God  She blinked and it was gone 
She doesnt say what she saw  swear it  Swear it wasnt real 
But he sees the way her eyes change and flicker  to that deep brimstone 
Pupils dilated and flickeringlike the devils very own 
God he saw  But he doesnt know quite what 
She shakes herself but cannot unsee the blood dripping down her chin
Predatory and delicious prey 
Visions of slick and slippery brushed through her hair burned the back of her eyelids 
Dangerous scenes and the thrill of the merciless kill
Of the innocent murder  Pointless  Worthless  
Why   He begs
Because she wanted to 
 
Angry  rather  son of a bitch
And then the inevitable You better watch your fucking dirty mouth
And then PAUSE
She wished suddenly to go back and be more upset
And to fight

Theres that thing  about wanting to  surprise and unnerve 
Of course  she disagree  thinks its defense mech 
To fight the fact that thats just who you are
And she feels twice as dirty and chewed 
And the person she wants to talk to most  
God  hes a coast away 

And cant talk to him about that shit 
And aint that poor girl already heard enough of her escapades  
Its just the bell ringing in her head
Didnt you want this  Why do you feel now all a sudden  
How to explain thats an instant sense of weakness 
Shed never do it  not really  and as soon as she saw the blonde she knew

He said talk about computer and space
And she shook her head and the Snake wrapped itself tight around her spine and began to
SQUEEZE
He was blonde and tall a little taller and funny and clever
And her breathing halted as the snake wound tighter
And yet Not The Same 
But shed felt that same selfentitled streak once before in tiny words
cept she knew she could fight them both 
cept she thought Fuck you 
And thought to spit Watch your whore mouth in an attempt to explain
I feel really upset  She Said In Her Head  And thats not fair
You dont get to make me feel anything 

BecauseNot Your Fault 
But then she stopped and wanted abruptly to cry
She missed him  lovely boy  and wanted to cry and explain into his shoulder 
About the way shed been treated growing up by Boys and Girls  make herself some sort of pity story  make herself into something weak and small
But she never was  she was tough  love  she was tough love  and tough hate
She remembers being told she might even say that she was everything
God  and then being told she was intimidating and scary and so no one talks to her
But she was intimidating and scary because nobody talks to her  and gotta protect yourself inside that shell
And proud and looked fearsome when she was angry as hell
But now shes just proud and alone 

She just all of a sudden wanted him home
And remembered that huge yellow halfmoon  driving home alone
Beginning to cry
And the moon shone down
Still 

Youre so  Ana said  and I didnt see straight for fourteen days  Youre so  Ana said  and I burned myself with a lighter and cut my long nails too short and it all hurt 
She visited me the night I met my rejection  Dressed in gold and with eyes deep amber and slit pupils  she told me Id never make a thing of myself  That I was a sad girl who wouldnt ever feel full again 
Ive been cursed with hunger  But no matter how much I eat  how much I consume  Im dark and empty  So I starve until I cant even stay and Im outside my own body  Climbing stairs makes my heart beat so fast Im going to be sick  Im still dark and Im still empty 
Youre so  Ana said  and took my dreams from me  Youre so  Ana said  and she showed me exactly how much I meant 
Ive been living in a place deep inside  and I try to tell  to say  I dont care anymore  But she shakes her headAna knows and she tells me this is all a show to try and cover up just how much I do  
Count on all my fingers the number of people who ever wanted to feel my pain  or have it explained to them  Ana narrows her eyes  because if they lie anywhere near as much as you do  how can you know  Trust anyone at all 
Eat yourself from the inside out obsess over the idea of selfconsumption  Inflict as much pain as she can on me I can take  I can take it  I can take too much vitamin D and drink so much water Im left sick and shivering underneath her covers 
Youre so  Ana said  and I remember her saying it  Youre so  Ana said  and she came in the guise of a friend  I didnt know about her then  and she insists I dont know about her now  But I do as she says  because  Ana knows best  


KEEP THE NAME FREEKEEP IT SEPARATE FROM ME
Im reminded of what I wrote about men
silly creatures we are
Im reminded of weakness and the touch of lips to neck
she was shaking with weakness  you see  and he still held her  you see
My GodIts no fair  its Him and me 

 I tried to write something about myself but couldnt see past you 
 the lover who tried to ring me  hes stuck listening to my voicemail as everything begins to spin and spin and spin 
 it spins and spins and spins out of control as Im lying  fucked up on my bedroom floor 

See they said that I wouldnt make it out
That Id give it up and let myself down
But Im stuck in rut 1 and theyll never forget who I was or what I did 
Ill have been their firsts
And Ill have done them over right

 I felt myself deep below baseline and underneath seas  until soon there was no woman left to be made of me anymore 
what an ugly refrain 
please listen to me talk about my pain 

I lost my mind down there
No  I didnt all make it out of gutter
You fucking liar 
Messed hair and messed brainsoup

 look how we made it 
 Ill never forget it 
 Ill never forgive those phonecallwords you said to me  and Ill always hate

My God Im so fucked right now I cant even make sense right now 
I saw Johnny and thought about you 
I saw her pretty red hair and thought about you 
I saw pleated skirts and drones and thought about you 
I thought about you 

	Thirtiethcentury automatons  the Good Church said 
We shall make them in our image 
So we did 
									And we became Gods 
	Sins we called them  Good Church agreedwe were Gods now  Our ultimate purpose realized  and we had lovers from the sky  We made Sins very beautiful  very strong  very dedicated  very lovely  very sleek  very new
	We made them hardy where we were weak
	And called them Wicked for it made ourselves so holy
	We said Here  have this and gave them life
	And laughed when they knelt

	They prayed Why  
Good Church said Because we could
And who was there to say that we could not



My eyes  they burned because of sleepbecause I had nonebecause they grew to hate me
Called myself Alone
Said What are you without your fun  without your man  Gotta be that kept woman I see in my dreams
Nearly no nights inand I hit my head and fell
SO THIS IS IT 
I tooktetrahedral lifea fall
And there was blood in my eyes nobody said to me it would burn
I SOLD MY SOUL FOR THIS 
I dont want to let gowho would I even be I couldnt bear to lose
Ezra said Save me some snow dont let your past go
And I said I would  so I gotta live
Until first fall
Leaves are brownfor nowbut I can smell it
Winter comes soon 

Carry On

Walking down  and shes getting thinner  See  she said  You set your goalsthen you smash those
And then what 
You carry on 
Said  carry on  like it was no big deal  like that didnt mean something more than it should
I hear those drums they beat ONETHOUSANDONETHOUSANDand ONETHOUSAND AGAIN
I cant get the drums out of my head
Gotta be undergotta be less than
You know  I was promised all of thisthis would end
When you meet below 140 consistently for about a week  you buy your GW1 reward
When you meet below 135 consistently and its soonitll be soon  you look yourself in the mirror and say what now  How do I change 
Look at self and see I can afford to lose another five
GW3 is 130 and BMI goes from a 20 5 to a 19 8
See  look at who you are now and go another round with the mirror try for 125 and a straight  round 19 0
Look at you 

Sunday
I didnt know  it was time to go
Eat three meals  shower every other day  remember to change your clothes
I didnt know  thoughts like that would appear
I didnt know and it was patheticupon the realization
You dont need anyone but yourself to do well
You cant be helped
I confessed  Wrote I need the support
But I didnt send it not the responsibilitynot the worrynot the prerogative
I just saved itso I could check it and say Look  I am doing so much better 
And I whispered it out loud 
Look  I have a problem 
But then I 
BLINKED 
And found myself outside Four days latermumbling and confused
Dark haired girl wavedasked if I was O K 
Shook my headIm just great
What a daywhat a day

Candy Boy

HMmmmMMmmmm  my cAndY bOy I missed you tonight
found love in the twisting of my bed sheets
it was far too hot for sleep
OH darling 
You gotta be somethin beauty originatedmade for no mannot even made for me
say oh  Eilidh  i was always made for myself
 oh  
Hes clever  Hes clever  Oh my  oh me 
Hes smart and twice as sharp as that barbed wire youre always goin on about
Quit your crying dearest  your dreams are realized  and now were lovers

I looked into deep pits of fiery helland it ate into me
butId never let that sorta thing bite youon the neck nah ah
Sweet Candy Boy  I lost my affiliation for bounce   and stopped escaping through a window to go a runnin through the night
Because it was time 4 me to GRoW Up  
Time to gET BiG and learn to fight for me again

Id teach you strength if I hadnt already learned that sorta thing from you 
Id say to you a million thanks if I didnt already know the word for one
See what Id do all because you did your life bravelyand beautifully
Id give you my whole WoRLd darlin
I really really would

To Be Greeted By Death
When you die  youll be greeted by Death 
Youll turn about  and hell just be there one day 
Youll say the first thing that comes to your mind  say   How do you do  
And hell say   Fine  how about you  

And from there  youll exchange customary pleasantries 
Its not like people think  you dont ever want to fight him  Youre not angry or upset  a little surprised perhaps you didnt have time to put out the good china or make little sandwiches to eat along with tea  but its no big deal  To be honest  hes pretty used to this sort of thing  being a surprise drop in that is  and when you offer to make quesadillas  he thanks you  
He wears a black hood and long robes  carries a scythe  that much is true  but the thing anyone neglected to tell you is about the eyes  They glow  and theyre blue  And hes very kind  as far as strangers go  but what you have yet to realize is that hes not really a stranger at all 
That  while youve never been quite so much as formally introduced  hes laid his hand on your shoulder at that girl  Sarahs  funeral when you were seven years old  He accidently brushed by you in the hospital  when you said that for Grandma to feel well again was your real Christmas wish  And hes sat quiet alongside you while you waited for the train to come 
Youll take a moment  look around  and you wont even think before you begin  You suddenly realize  you have to tell someone  You have to explain  youve suddenly realized all of this stuff youve never even thought of before and that  you cant just let it all go to waste 
So you start  you start to tell him everything  Death stands there  still  and he listens to you  Perhaps you ramble a tad  doesnt matter though  nothing matters now anyhow  its just you and Death and in the inbetween world you exist in  time is meaningless  So you stand there for days  you speak for weeks and years  and you try to tell him  show him all of the ways that you made a difference  How much you mattered 
Until  quite suddenly  you run out of words  You just fall abruptly silent  There is nothing more to say and youve already told him everything you ever knew  So what comes next you wonder 
You ask  patient Death   What now  
And he stands from where hes been sitting on your worn leather couch  all this time  You rise too  from your Fathers favorite armchair  Death  he points to a big wooden door  he doesnt speak now  Hes feeling the same thing you are  and youre ready for what happens next 
The great wooden door  it opens and all you see is a desert  The desert  it stretches on for miles and miles  as far as the eye can see  And buried underneath the sand  you know  are all of the things you ever had that became lost or forgottenif only you were to dig down deep enough to unearth them 

 Its been not so long since Ive been here before   You say  and swear  if Death could smile  he would because he thinks youre funny  He gets such a kick outta you  he looks forward to seeing you again soon 
You have to cross the desert  it will take a while  But just as you now remember being born  you remember everything youve ever learned  You feel  youre prepared for this  the greatest journey  and the only one that matters 
Looking back  youve made some mistakes  but you no longer have shame for those things  Death  well  he watches you from behind  Death  he thinks youre clever  He thinks youre smart  you see  he thinks he might just even like you 
Youve stepped through the door now  and as soon as your foot touches sand you know the way back home has closed  Your feet burn already  and the sun beats down  and you begin to walkknowing immediately what you must do 
Death  he ducks his head  and wishes he could smile  Because hed smile for you  and he thinks youre going to make it 

Need

 No need for sleep   the god said
And I nodded  no need  of course
How many days in are you now  I cant remember
Arent you supposed to have a good memory
I do    it just doesnt always seem to work when it comes to stuff like this
 No need for thoughts   the god spoke
And I nodded again  of course  no need for it
No need for those sorts of things these days 
Just gotta make your way through it
Go one by one and make your way on and on
Why are the gods speaking to you
I dont know  but I know this
You havent got all that much longer  You havent got all that much more to wait 
It can all still turn out okay 


Doctor Richards
The doctor  Doctor Richards   was a cold man  A cold man indeed  I thought 
Without much of a sense of soul and nothing  we thought  deep in his chest
We thoughtmaybe hes just a strange man  Doctor Richards 
But Doctor Richards  he fought to cut a creature into me
	that Good Doctor  did what he thought was best
	that Good Doctor Richards  played a game with me  because he thought he
could win 
Oh  Doctor Richards  what a beast you sowed in me
This is your fault  my good doctor  what you did you did by yourself
No one chose this mistake but you  and what a grave  grave mistake to make 

Water In The Bones
Water in the bones  is what was in me
Was I born in a place without land  then how was i made  
I dont know where I came from  I lost myself down underneath mud
only mud here 
no stone to be seen 

I banged a fist on the hotel room wall  and yelled  GrOW A sPiNE     At the girl on the other side
Its water in the boneswhat a heavy girl its made me
Its water in the bonesthats gone and weighed me down
No more water  I want to hear in reply 
I grew a spine and there was no more water on the other side 

I had it all ways 
I got it cold  I had it hot 
I got my blood to boil in me  and my extremities to break off and freeze
I got what I needed  the water would make me strong
The water in the bones  would let me drown
Water in the bones  would hold me down

where did I come from 
and may I return again  someday 

Lovely Boy
And thats what you call a
LOVELY BOY 
And he is a lovely boy
Asks me to touch his face 
My lovely boy
Tells me he loves me
Lovely boys
Lonely boys will tell you that they love you
But lovely boys
The lovely boy
Does not put his hand up my skirt
When I tell him no
Lovely boy 
Has all these lovely squishy feelings
And at best 
Lovely boy sees something in me that
Does not exist 
And at worst
I feel nothing at all 
Ever
For anyone
For a lovely boy
But a lovely boy does not care 
As the lifespan for a lovely boy is short
Lovely boy says that its okay that I do not kiss
And lovely boy
I am so mean  lovely boy 
Lovely boy
He literally cannot save you
Lovely boy
I wrote this poem in my head as you lay in my arms
And all I was thinking of was what words were next 

A Message
 Gods sending me a message  He said 
He turns to me   And hes saying youve failed  
He blinks but has no eyes
Just two dark and empty eye sockets staring back
 Hes saying youve failed   He says

God didnt care for me  the mess I made
 I gave you one job   he said
And then to get my revenge
I binged and purged
Felt that cold water slither and freeze down my throat
Drunk until I ached
And my bones shook
God cant tell me shit anymore
Met him twice and wasnt impressed
I have no faith left
And I fucked his sister  and hes got a holy grudge
An empty eyed mad man lies in my backyard under dead grasssix feet down
Cut his head right offyear two
And Id fucked myself

Fought and cut  and now shes dead
Watching TVtelevision head  stereo up outta her mind
There was no soul in this food

FEED ME
She groans  eating and eating
Bingepurge and bingepurge all over again
FEED ME SHE SCREAMS
But God just licks a chicken bone and laughs

Strong

I know its not fair of me  but cant I tire of being fair 
Am I allowed to put myself first  just sometimes 
How can I be such a crybaby 
And at the same time have no feelings 
Not good  Im not good  But Id never say the weakness
Can I afford to be forward  Or is that too scary  to say that I want to fuck him 
I can no longer count on my hands how many times people have told me that guys hesitate to approach me because I am  intimidating  
I picture myself twelve feet tall bending down at the waist to try and converse with men and it makes me laugh 
I picture myself deformed  nagging  a horrid wicked witch of the west  and isnt that what they mean  Im so sure it must be  and I no longer laugh  Whats wrong with me  What can I change 
Speak to me  Anybody  I yearn for human contact in a way that is so hard to describe  I just want to be touched  please  touch me  Please 
Its frowned on  if  during sex  you lean down and whisper into your lovers ear   I dont know who I am anymore  
But Im blinded by passion and physical pleasure  and I apologize for my vulnerability  it just slipped out  I swear   Im sorry 
Does it make me old fashioned  that saying the word love is a grand declaration  
Am I losing you  boy  What can I do to keep you with me  What will it take on my part to convince you from the truth that I dont love you for you  but for your hands and the moles on your neck  
Im not above using people and theres no one I use worse and more violently than myself 
Be gentle  My body is strong  and capable  but I fear sometimes my mind plays tricks on me  turns my reality not into one of those fun house mirrors but a mirror in a department store that makes you look just a little bit fatter and shorter than you actually are but its just subtle enough that you believe its an accurate representation 
My body is strong  it has knowledge dating back to the very first speck of life on Earth  and there arent enough apologies in the world to express to it how sorry I am for doing what Ive done to it am still doing to it
My body is strongfeel it  touch it  grab it and bite it  You cannot break it  I used to be like jello  but now Im strong  I think I always was 

Candy Cane
The teeth wrote about themselves 
I imagined you a candy cane I twirled around my index finger
Here  see it  Lick it  Chew it  Taste it 
I saw you around my parties  gave you a mask made of lace did introduce you as yourself
I did watch as you gave advice
And I did take notes as you spoke 
I was in giggles  so eager to prove that I was right
Haha thats what I said 
And still you kept on until it was long after midnight
New Years and you were my midnight kiss  candy cane
Here  see it  I licked right up that pretty neck and did hear the lovely boy gasp 
And you  candy cane  I cut my teeth in your shoulder and you did not flinch
Ive met a lovely boy  and its you  candy cane
And see that  Thats an Ugly Boy and he is not you  luv
Ive met many Ugly Men and he is only one of some 
And you are not an Ugly Man
A lovely boy and hes twice as sharp as barbed wire 
When he wants to be
Sharper than me
Lovelier than me 
Who is this likeable human being 
Lovely boy  you choose me 
Its a candy cane  I taste you in every holiday liquorfilled chocolate bottle
You are sharp as the teeth that went and wrote about themselves
Acerbic and biting 
Bite me
Thats it  I see it again  and thats it 
I feel it in the energy whipping around your head in the shape of a 
I feel nothing at all 
How does nothing feel to someone so lovely as you
When you kiss me does it feel like space 
Im so empty  do I devour you 
Arent you tired 
Ive seen how you look  and how you make yourself vulnerable
And its all I can do not to be sick when I unhook my bra
And Its just chest I say
And I find in that moment that it is true 
And I found in every moment after that to be true
And So what if were using them 
I asked  who cares 
And somehow there was no reply
Who needs love 
Arent you frightened of needing someone other than yourself
I do not love a lovely boy 
All that means is I want to dismantle him 
I told him so one night  I just want to break you 
Press as hard as I can until you finally crack right in half
A lovely boy is appalled at the thought of ever loving another 
And if everyone in my life is an adjective what am I 
Ive fallen so many times down and down and down and dont know who I am now 
Underneath the toughened skin
I called you a lovely boy to your face and if you ever see this poem youll know its about you
I called you a lovely boy to your face and if you ever see this poem 
Youll know Ive been thinking about you 

A Phone Call From 
Youve got me so fucked up
And its the only sort of love Ive ever known
I went and walked the streets  stalked my fears into dark alleyways and carried them  dead  over one shoulder
Baby  youve got me so fucked up I cant sleep
Lover  I refuse to admit faultwill not apologize
I shouldnt have told you that
 Whats your definition for love   I ask and what he says isnt love at all thats lust  Lover 
Sometimes I can hear it in the way he speaks
 It was just a mimic   and he hadnt really understood at all 
Its a punishment  get angry  get upset  or else everything I said was worth exactly nothing
At all 

Calling For God
I spent all that time calling for God
 Did you forget about me  
 Where are you  
 Dont you love me  
And I was all alone
Convinced of my own suffering
And when I see stained glass windows Ill think forever of church
Of worship
 I love you  
He told me but I didnt hear him over the clamor of church bells
Picked up the phone to call but all I ever get is a dial tone
 Hello  
And I spent all that time calling for God
And I was told He has a plan for me
 Then hes one twisted guy  
Because I wanted to be there for Him but he wasnt for me
 You cant know his ways  
So how can he know mine 
How is this kind 
I am not kind 
So how can He be 
And I spent all that time calling
And Ill never forgive myself 

The Problem 
And the problem was  all along
That I was not thinking like a person
That I did not think like a person
Was the problem all along

The problem all along  you see
Was I did not think of him as a person
And that was my downfall all along
The problem you  see

The things I would have liked I could not do
And the things I did I did not like
I lied to myself
And will lie to him because of this

All that backwards speak
Has gone and spoken itself backwards
I dont know what it was I meant to say
Or if what I said was exactly what I meant

But its what I did
And its what I said 
 
And Ive seen it  welcomed myself right into that door
Hugged his mother
And then proceeded to put my wet socks in the dryer
And my shoes by the fireplace

And Ive heard it  when he asks me if I have any skeletons in my closet
Did I lie 
Or is it just none of his business 
Regardless  I continued on and told him not to touch me there  and offered no explanation

And Ive felt it  when my stomach began to turn
Welcome to your destination of holy shit  Im fucking this up arent I 
And congratulations  youve ruined everything
And I did

And Ive met it  when I was finally left alone
And I was all by myself
Sicknened and disappointment in myself
And he tells me he still loves me and that theres other things we can do

But I kiss it  when I realize that  
Im just as broken as I ever suspected 

Love me even though

My little sister cries when I leave
 Its just a body  I tell her
 Its only my body thats left you 
And she cries
So I give her the cat as a peace offering
The kitty promptly runs away
And she cries 
Late into the night  she asks for me
But Im too busy
And she cries
And I bring the dog as a peace offering
And the dog does not understand tears
But she worries in her puppy way 
That is my little sister
And I am her big sister 
I dont know what exactly I look like through her eyes
But Ill try to hide all the worst parts 
Thats my little sister and she cries 
So I curl up next to her and the puppy snuggles at our feet
Thats my little sister and
She loves me even though
I leave 

Scripture
That very night  tattooed it across her back
Across the pane of her shoulders read Ill never forgive you for what you did to me
In two rows of neat black text
She blames herself
Writes dont trust your weakness over and over again in red sharpie  on her arms  on the palms of her hands  and on the insides of her thighs
There is no end 

In GoldDirtGraveyard
You think Ive never looked
And seen the face of ugliness
You think all that time spent
In golddirtgraveyard I never
Lost some things 
Ive spent nearly twentyfour months on this moon
Twentyfour months Ive just consumed and consumed
I asked about the bird song
And they played me a recording
Look  You could someday have this too 
I asked about the suffering
And they chittered on in nervous fervor
Grey dust has coated everything I own
Its in my lungs and in my nose
They sent me to the graveyard
Gold nuggets buried deep within the plots
Ordered me to pull up headstones
And burn corpses
And to keep my mouth shut
No man made it away from that place
And I dug and dug until one day
I curled up  immersed in soft dirt 
And slept my life away 

Lovers Poetry
Stay and save me lover  Im drowning
I showed you the quicksand
Your face stained gold and a cigarette in your right hand
You were apathetic
Stay and save me lover  I said
But lover did nothing of the sort  
And all he did was watch me sink 

There is no love in these bones  I said
And there is no heart in this chest  I said
I sucked everything I had out of my bone marrow
Ate the beating organ behind my ribs
Had to do it 
I needed to survive  I was so hungry

He says he thinks its sweet when its hopeless
What do you write about  He asked
I replied 
Or did I 
Its all a joke  Im real and not
A cat with mottled green eyes  put me in a box
Am I dead or alive 

Drop those beliefs
Grind them underneath the palm of your hand
Burn your hand on the butt of your lovers cigarette
Because if you arent careful hell see you
And be out for blood
If he can bring himself to get out of bed 
 
The Killing Joke
The joke that killed 
The joke that was the one 
The credits 
And we left the theater 

Daddy teaches me that
The men Ill meet
The women Ill see
All want something from me

Showed me that joke
Explained about the men
Who just wanted to see
The world burn

It was all spoken in terms
Of metaphor 
And tales of Gotham 
Peppered my goodnight dreams

The man with the smile
He haunted the insides
Of the great dollhousemansion
Lived under a stone

Just waiting to be turned over 

Ive woken up in a world without men 
Its a world where there appears to be something suspiciously absent  
Where have they gone 
And  I know Im not supposed to think these things but I miss them 
Theres a part of me that remembers the sounds of their voices  and how much I liked to hear them speak and sing 
These are subversive  dangerous thoughts  I know  but what of it 
Theyre my own  and my own alone and Im sorry if you dont understand
What its like to hold a man between your hips and keep him there with just the power of your gaze
How theyre powerful and angry beasts  but if you whisper the right words  touch the right places you can make them obey you
Where have all the men gone  Am I the only one who noticed  there one day and gone the next 
Perhaps  but perhaps not  
Regardless  I just wished to record  that I do enjoy them 
That they have become absent  as they appear to be now  does indeed sadden me 

BIRDS

Pink birds circle around a dark fountain pool  filled with water
Where their masters have tossed many a coin into its basin
A bird for each copper piece and a drop of water for every feather
Ive always loved their singing  their throaty trill
Never fearful for they are no songbirds
Delicate with talons of honed diamond they are fearless in the face of danger
Never caught  never caged 
Ive always admired their spirit 
Ive always liked how they were built to go fast and stay strong
How has each a master and how has each master a teacher
For nobody learns the way of the birds without first having been taught

SDRAWKCAB
I just woke up one day and started to read things backwards
And the more backwards that I read
The more wrong and silly things forwards seemed to be
Try fast forwarding and things become highpitched gibberish
And arent people always telling you not to rush through life 
To instead take a step back 
The thing is  Ive taken their advice  except I dont stop at just one step
Ive taken one and then another and then I repeat
I started by retracing all the steps I ever took
Until Id become a child once again
My fingers gripped around my fathers thumb
My eyes a colorless blue  staring at my mothers lips  wondering who they are
So I keep taking steps back  until Ive relived my whole life in reverse
Worked my way backwards through all my past lives
Waved a greeting to God as he retreated into the future
At first its scary  not knowing where youre going  not seeing exactly where your next step takes you
But doesnt it comfort you to know  everything done here
Has all been done before 

Second Time
The second time I met Death 
I was at a crosswalk 
I looked him in the eye
I am flesh
I am soul
I was sweat and I was blood
But Death cared for neither  and sent me on my way 
I couldnt sing for him subtract a body 

When she comes for you
Fight her with your 
Teeth and your narrow eyes
Your words are meaningless here

When she comes for you
Let the hope of morning
Keep you
And let it keep your eyes opengaze sharp

When she comes for you
Tell her no  and then 
succumb 

A Heartbeat
I bought all of my favorite personality traits from a carnival barker
He sold me many things made my hair darker
my Sarcasm  and my Pain  and my Smile
told me they would help me feel alive awhile
All for a poem
He told me to write something beautiful  that I owed him
And I did but I cant remember a single word
I wrote him the most beautiful poem hed ever heard
And he told me so  the most beautiful thing in all the time hed ever lived
He asked if I had anything else to give
Gestured to my Strength and my Intelligence  fully functional and contained deep within my bone marrow
I told him they were both just borrowed 
And that one day  my parents might ask for them back
He pushed me farther  his fingernails painted black
Pointed down underneath my skin he asked about my Soul
Twirled his mustache and asked me to name a price  and that everyone always sold
Told him it was mine  he had teeth like a crocodile
 So its not borrowed   He said  a knowing smile
No  I told him  It wasnt  But that I had to protect it
 So whatll it be   He asked  opened his briefcase and showed all the things hed collected
Beauty  Love  Passion  Hatred  Sadness  Death  the ability to fall in love with anyone
The answer to life  the ultimate question  Gods birth certificate  and a lottery ticket that always won
 Theres more   He said  
He put a hand on his second briefcase  but I asked him to stop
He looked at me with curious eyes and said  Whatll it be  
I opened my mouth to reply but he put a hand up and told me
 And whats the point of this  This whole thing  
 Whats the lesson  That you shouldnt sell your Soul for anything  
 That your Soul it infinitely more valuable than all  Any mortal purchase at all  
 That a deal with the Devil is always so wrong  
 Whats the point Eilidh  Why are you writing this  was that the point you originally had  
I blinked in surprise 
And the carnival barker had gone  and instead it was me  looking into my own eyes
Staring at a reflection in a fun house mirror
At first the image was blurry but then it became clearer
 Is the moral of the story that it was You the whole time   She asks me
 Or is it about how you are your own worst enemy  
She is smirking and leering at me  her voice is a purr
I dont know  I tell her
And shes back to laughing at me
 Youd sell everything you were ever worth to be a genius  or someone with eternally good looks  you see  
 If someone ever asked you to trade your soul for the opportunity to be great   Shes got an expression thats bittersweet
 youd do it in a heartbeat 

Necklace
My lover  she aint the sorry type
Shes got a necklace  that she always wears
Got the word  bitter  tucked underneath her blouse
Pressed into her chest

There was something she wrote  about apologies
And for so long  I thought the necklace
Said  bitch 

Rhiannon

I rode for fifteen days and through fifteen nights
On the back of a great serpent
To find this place
And when I arrived
My violeteyed woman
She had the gall to tell me that I was the monster all along
And to be ashamed 

But I felt no shame and I kissed her hard to show her
Just how much shame had a hold on me
And took her to her bed
And whispered in her ear  just how much
Shame
Was in me 

And we made love  my violeteyed woman
And me
I had her and she was mine
But she doesnt keep me
My great serpent slithered around my ankles
Kissing at my feet
And when the sun rose and the
Seventeenth day arrived
I found myself lost in the desert
With only my serpent and my memories of her
Violet Eyes
And I was shameless 

Birds Like Me
Do me a favor 
Tell me what you think about me
There are no birds like me you see
Talk about the Planet Paradise  like Ive never been

Do you take me to see the diamond waterfalls
On Midnight 
Ive spent a year learning about peace
And places Ill never live to see

Shadows that eat flesh  libraries that are silent
There are no birds like me you see
There are no birds 
Like  Me 

How much more convincing will it take 
I could show you my feathers  
A set of dark red talons 
Oh  there are no birds like me 

I make the sun come out 
Shine its great fire round my head
It is hard work 
And ever since I began  Ive spent many years learning about need

There are no birds like me

A puppet with no strings 
No strings on me 
Ive learned many things
Chiefly  people will be people
And to treat them accordingly 

Ive never dreamt of things like flight
Instead  Ive swam
Ive been snatched at by rip tides
And pulled under by blood hungry mermaids
There are no birds like me

I forgive my body  for panicking when I hold my breath
And these days I cant swim no more
And instead I run
And my joints groan
Ive never been a runner

I cannothavenot seen the end of the line
Where the lovely train pulls into its last station
Ive never been a jumper
Be fearful of the wheels on a steam engine 
They like to catch on feathers and theyll
Eat you
Up

There are no birds like me
As far as Ive met
As far as Ive seen
I would like to swim again  I would like to jump offa this train
I would like be as convincing as I need to be
But how 

There are no birds like me 

Just Another
The maniacal laughterit was done selfishly
Standing in the shower  and it hit me
The realization that Im not real
And that Ive never been
Going through life as if life was the one going through me
Days in and out  and bittersweet memories of the people that love me 
And letting people read my poetry
How did I get from there to here
When I burned myself  in one horizontal stipe across my forearm
I came back to myself
And apologized to my body for everything Id ever done to it
 Im the Gordian Knot and Ive been cut in half  and now Im slowly just unraveling 
Ive slowly been losing touch ever since I was a child
Dodging questions I  myself  refuse to answer
 Do you like it here  
 Where have you been all these years  
I havent figured it all out yet  but Im willing to try again
Ill try and try and again and again
Ive been welcomed back  and as a reward Ill be kissing the softest lips Ive ever felt
And hating it the whole while
I cry everywhere I go  nowhere is safe
And everybody is on guard  because the day before yesterday  Jesus told us all that we were all just supposed to sit and wait
And I been waiting  waiting and failing
Day after day and day after day
Ive passed every test except for the ones that mattered 
And I for someone who cries as much as I do  I know Ill always be stronger than you
I have so many questions I feel that Ive yet to ask
And theyre all about myself
Ive been told that you are who you are when youre naked in the shower
And that you are who you are when youre alone and theres silence
And all I can ever think about myself is that I sing in the shower
And that when theres silence its always so profound  I just like to sit and listen
Perhaps I only like myself when Im by myself
Its only around others that I have the problem
The Way It Was isnt something Ill ever manage to forget 
Although sometimes I do lead myself to questioning whether or not any of it was real
If my entire past is just a fever dream I had one night 
And couldnt wake up from
Nowadays  theres people always yelling at me
Its the kind of thing you dont realize affects you until you do
All I know now is that when I see her  shell ask and Ill start to cry
And all Ill want is to be held by someone who doesnt want anything from me
Except to help me
And I know that Ill use her up too
Until she doesnt want me anymore
Dont let her stick it to your heart so hard
Shes just another girl 

Beauty
Ill never get tired of telling you youre beautiful
Its like you havent heard it before
Or youve heard it too many times
And now it rings false
Youre beautiful
I want to say it to your face
And whisper it in your ear
You are beautiful
Ill never get tired of the words and if you ask
Ill say them
Over and over
Until I cant anymore

A wild woman  tired of being tied down
Once in a million years  she rises

Ive summoned a wild woman  begged for her help
Told her how I was failing  how I was becoming fractured

A wild woman gave me one recommendation apathy
And I took it and ran

A wild woman  she feels no love
But shes so much more fun because

A wild woman she likes to kiss  women and men
Shes buried deeptaking on the fungi while I writhe

A wild woman said to me I would not be free as long as I
Let my lovers keep me

She said to let them go  she told me to 
Leave them lone 

She had me in tears  saying I needed to be a good riddance
And make a way free from obligation

She said the key was uncaring
A wild woman told me affection comes in burstsand nothing is certain

She said that there are people who want me dead
And that the secret is to already be that  deep inside and to feel nothing


Quicksand Part III

Was written for the quicksand man
Who meant to pull me down
The final drowning
Atlantis could not be defended
And the man proceeded to hold me underneath the liquid land

Said it would take something bigger
Said to me  it would take something special
The man pulled me under and I looked up through mud and sand
I could see right through to sky
I tried to swim up  precious air  clawing hand over hand

Quicksand man reminded me that this was my home
That it was all Id known
Clasped my frantic hands and asked me to come with peace
He said  hed remind me who I was as his lover
He said  whatever Id been doing before I couldnt keep it up forever

What the quicksand man did
He promise me things he could not give
What the quicksand man did
I never have to forgive
After all that fightall that strugglehe still took me back
I was still his lover

I hope that we are not alone
I hope that we are not alone 

There must be some other out there
Or what a sad  lonely existence it would be

I hope that we are not alone 

Come on down  visit us  my noisy lovely blue pebble
Filled with people who look like me
There has to be someone  whod take me up on an offer of tea
Dont forget about me

I hope that we are not alone 

I dont want to believe that its so empty outside
It would break my heart  I think  that we would search and search and find nothing
Just darkness  and the echo of our own voices calling out

I hope that we are not alone 

I hope that we are not alone 

There must be some other out there
Or what a sad  lonely existence it would be

I hope that we are not alone 

Come on down  visit us  my noisy lovely blue pebble
Filled with people who look like me
There has to be someone  whod take me up on an offer of tea
Dont forget about me

I hope that we are not alone 

I dont want to believe that its so empty outside
It would break my heart  I think  that we would search and search and find nothing
Just darkness  and the echo of our own voices calling out

I hope that we are not alone 

David
David wanted me 
Allasudden I was new and shiny silvery and fresh fleshed
He looked me up and down and bared his teeth
Id have you  He said

Where were you  David  when I was a kid
Im not going to pretend I havent changedand that you dont know me now 
Where were you when we were children 
But Im here now  He says  And what do you need of me 

I havent had the best trackrecord with boys  I think 
I got me one  one for the road  one and the same for the monogamy
And suddenly I was a thing
Boys  They wanted me  They wanted my body 
Allasudden I was FUNNYSMARTCLEVERAND CUTE
ALLASUDDEN I blinked and had a power  and I had a lust for more
I probably wouldnt fucked them all if I coulda
And I heard it over and over that I wasnt like all those other girls

And the longer I looked  the longer I stared
All my suitors looked the same
They all wanted sweet sweet escape and I didnt intimidate them as much as I shouldve
They all stood very very straight and were very very sure of themselves
But I found it soothing 
And I leaned back and spent my time dreaming of them on their knees
And heads bent in servitude

Ive never given up on that dream arrogance and spirit attract me
I like to argue  and I want a man who can give that to me
Which is a mistake waiting to happen  so when David looked at me and asked
What do you want me to do 
I told him that he should do as I said
That he should do as I told him to

Ive had not such a good trackrecord with men  I think 
Ive made some mistakes  perhaps 
Ive wanted to subjugate and to humiliate my partners
But Ive tried so hard to be peaceable because I know that that is wrong
It is aberrant to want to do those sorts of things
Ive wanted to hurt the boys who only wanted me only after I became all ugly on the inside
Ive wanted the oldgirl I was before 
I look at myself and feel shame  sometimes 
For what Ive let myself do  and have to say there would be those who would seek to consume me should I have stayed kind

I gave up on being a lovely girl  and I wanted to hate with all my heart
I wanted to hurt  wanted to get off on it
I wanted to do it because I liked it  and for no other reason 

So David  when he knelt for me  
I felt it surge upwards from behind my hips up to the tip of my nose
It rested in my cheeks  and I felt on fire
Not so still I was of flame and I was of pure hatred and unadulterated heat and arousal
He looked up at me and I stared back
I would have you  I said 
And you would worship me 


Be The Man
Im going to be the man
Call it what you want  call it what you will  but Im going to 
Be a Man About It
And when it rainsI wont flinchand when it poursIll let myself drown
Im going to be the man I was told I wouldnt be

Ive spent time in the earth  digging down and eating worms
And I was a beetle for a while until I got bored  and decided Id be a man again  and when I blinked  OH  Id grown 

You cant shy away youre a man now 
Youre tough as can be  now youve gotta pack your things and go

The Last Summer
 The Last Summer  the Last Summer comes soon   said the wind
	 How do you know   Asked the bumblebee
	The wind shivered   I just saw the daffodil  in the hand of the Oracle  the end comes soon  The Last Summer  
	The bumblebee was not in fear of the summer  or even the end of it  But the bumblebee shouldve been afraid  because after the Last Summer  the certainty of the sun  the growth of the flowers would be certain no more 

	 I am afraid of no Last Summer   Said the crow  who happened to overhear   The summer comes  and then it goes  Theres no rhyme or reason to it so whats the point in being bothered  
	The wind and the bumblebee ignored the crow  because the crow was a known sceptic and pessimist  who just wanted people to disagree  so he could fight them  
	
	But the large white cat that lived up by the dairy farm  who was sunning himself on a large log  happened to be listening in as cats are ought to do  and he tilted his great head to the side and purred   The summer goes only if you cant keep it to your chest   His large yellow eyes followed the bumblebee and then flicked to the crow   You catch the summer  and if you just dont let it go  it cant leave   And as if to illustrate  the white cat lunged for the skeptical crow  The cat caught the crow and in one bite  swiftly dispatched it  The cat from the dairy farm looked up at the bumblebee  immensely pleased   The summer only ends if you let it  

	The bumblebee didnt know what to believe  should the Last Summer be feared  Or should it be fought  Or perhaps there was some other thing that it should be  but the bumblebee was not very clever  so he didnt figure it out 

	The rivers had been flooding their banks for weeks  and the peepers had grown into frogs  and everything was changing  But the bumblebee  neither cared for change nor for things to stay the same  Now he just worried about the summer that would be the last 

	A girl and boy  standing on a hill  The girl with the daffodil in hand  and the boy standing next to her 
	 This is the Last Summer   She said  and there was quiet  only the sound of the eavesdropping wind   And I go away soon  
	The boy said nothing  and it wouldntve mattered even if he had  because it wouldntve changed anything 

	The bumblebee witnessed only some of this  but it was enough for him to wonder if the third thing you could do when faced with the Last Summer was to simply accept it 

Thats the Weekend
Thats the weekend  I go and go  and then  theres the weekend 
	 You cant keep living like this   I said to myself in the mirror  I hadnt eaten in nearly a day  and Id woken up at five PM   But its not as bad as it used to be  
	Im sitting in class  and I finally snap and say  Im tired  Im tired of rape being used as a shortcut to character development   Fuck that noise 
	But  then  thats the weekend  I go and go  and then  theres the weekend 
	
	Ive gotta say  that Ive got plans and my plans have got me  but I dont have the drive  I fear I dont have the passion to get to the places that I want to go  I only do things that I want to do  and dont do the things I shouldthe things that I have to 
	Theres so much I feel that I oughta do  but I dont know when Ill find time to do them in between all this muckin about
	 Ive got plans   I say   But I dont have the will  I fear  to pursue them as I should   I whisper  into my palms as I cryIm going to end up as nothing 

	Rail against the machine  and just sit there  crying as the train comes athunderin closer to where youre tied
	But  sometimes I wake up  in the morning and I dont care where I go  Fuck that noise 
	I wake up to wake up another day  and aint that living  Aint that  what its all about  Its all about final fires and final wakes and final grandstands before the door shuts and the sun sets and were done  after all of that  I wont be able to look back on my life and think that Ive done something worth anything at all

Ice
I got called iceprincess until I got old  and then I was icequeen
I got called frigid  and hard  and what did that mean  

I kept my window open  and let the wind whistle in and cut through me  remind me of who I was
I spent the whole collection of seasons  downing icecold water to make me thin and to give my bones a tremble
I was cold  Cold to the core  and I did not care

Summers a vacation  summer belongs as a holiday destination  Its brief and lovely time but I was enamored with the seasons antipode
I still love my moniker  let it serve as a reminder as to the purpose of the winds whistle and its loving slice

I heard my own thoughts thinking and I curled up deep inside myself  and wondered about the future  and whether or not hearing your own thoughts thinking was conducive to my health
It was the end  though  the end of the line  and the ice was laid to rest finally and I looked in the mirror to discover than only my head was froze  that my heart never had been

Water Spirit
I found a singing water spirit in the abandoned wood 
He promised me  a babbling brook  and endless love with endless life to live
He promised me  the findofalifetime and a lover that would remain sweet
And I said  to the water spirit   What do you want from me  
And he just shrugged   What would you give me  for all that  anyway  

It was a dark pool  adjacent to the spring  and the spirit was a man with pale blue skin looking up at me 
I had nothing to give  nothing to spare  not even the pennies I kept sewn into my heart to remind me of my commodity  and I needed the iron nails in my pockets to ward off the fairies that lived in the wood
But when I said all that  he again just shrugged and shook his head 
That wily water spirit  he gestured for me to come into his lovely little spring
The waters just right  just like you like
Come along  love  youre alright

I was divested of all will to stay by the bank  and I dove right in
My clothes dissolved like papiermâché and I fell deep in love with the fresh water taste
The water spirit  he said   Come along   and he gestured away from the shore  said  Come along   and I followed close behind
We swam for many days  and we met in an
Underwater world  what a beautiful underwaterplace

Water spirit said wed get along just fine  said that he and I would do fine  here in underwater world and underwater heaven
There were towering buildings  towering women with long flowing hair  and towering volcanic spires
And I didnt think about that abandoned wood  or those frightening fay I tried in vain to ward away

Water spirit and I got along perfectly well  he promised me the findofalifetime  and endless love for endless life
And I got all those things  I just had to swim
I was promised the ability to wish away  all those things that made me so sad  all those things that made me feel so complicated  all those things that made it hard to love me
And so I swam  and swam
I heard the water whisper it briefly You Killed Him
You Murdered A Man Dead
Because Your Attentions Are Fleeting
You Should Be Ashamed
And  my God  I was

Water spirit  I prayed  come take me awayI dont know where youve gone  and now Im lost  its too dark down where I am now
I want to go home 

But water spirit  he was gone  hed never really been there at all
I didnt think any of it was real  I didnt think any of what I did that day was true
What great mistake have I made 
That wily water spirit man was nothing if not a reflection of me  
The heavy water in my ears  shouting 
Come Back Home 
You Cannot Sleep This One Off
You Cannot NotCare Anymore
You Must Return Home
You Do Not Belong Here 

And its scary  but I woulda died there I know
I woulda let myself get consumed by the water sunk in my bones It woulda killed me  I think 
A water spirit  be damned
I wanted to return home to that wood  and those clothes I had left dissolved  I wanted my iron and copperback secure in my fist
My GodI wanted my blood to come back  and the flush in my cheeks to return
I was tired of being dead  I was tired of being cold
And  by God  I wanted to be warm 

Good Luck
Good luck sugarsweet girls 
I coulda sworn I saw angry waves agatherin outside
A storms coming soon  Ill blink and all my cotton candy will have melted away

Good luck to my angry way of being
I coulda sworn that there was water aleaking inside
All of my candles are dimming  there is no light left in my empty room

Good luck passionfruit cakes sitting on the kitchen table
I coulda sworn the smell of sweet oranges still perfumes this place
A silly dream it was all a silly dream  I know  I know  I spent hours changing my clothes just to look back and wonder what any of that was for

Good luck me
I coulda sworn it was cool and doused in thickly syrup
But the river had been frozen over and the ducks had come home to roost far too early  I couldnt sleep for days and now it is too late


Déjà Vu from the Black Lagoon
Bad déjà vu
Its coming up  bubbling up from the bottom of the back lagoon
I go up the stairs  and am reminded of what occurred here

Bad déjà vunot gonna let you forget
Its coming soon  to theaters near you heavy dark syrup to wade through
I am standing in a room  and am reminded of what occurred in there too

Bad déjà vu  women in widebrimmed hats telling me that theyre tired
Its coming home  home to roost with you and the great big birds
I am in a place Id rather not ever return to

Bad déjà vu
Its coming  its gone  just a little memory come up from the past to get you
I wade back home again  through the black lagoon  and I do not sink  I do not see myself going back to that room again anytime soon

Rorschach 
He said hed fuck some sense back into me 
So he did  it was black ink splotches on white cardstock  I loved it  when he held them up and asked what I saw  I saw no butterflies
So he said hed been thinking about me and wondering what best to do with my body when I came home again
I have dreams  I say  About tying you up  sometimes about hurting you  then kissing your neck and your throat

That was the man with the uniform  watching me from the other river bank dark hat pulled low over his face  his fists stuffed deep in his pockets
I called across  Whats your name  Stranger 
But he did not answer  simply stared
I vowed Id have him then  I looked at him  and though he could have been death or someone much worse  I made a promise to split him opencleave im in half and then lick my blade clean

With his teeth he tore a chunk of flesh from my inner thigh and called me a fighter  I replied  my blade is bathed in ice and made strong from the many folds of steel within
He said there wasnt another  to that I did not dignify a reply and all I felt was funny and like I was breathing thick clouds of sheeps wool 
I think that whatever this is  it could be much worseI could bring down hell upon the man underneath me  I could kill him in his sleep

Whata relationship  whata ride
Id be on top one moment and then on my knees with my throat full the next 
Dont you want to ask me  About the ones before  I asked
He didnt shake his head all I could hear were bellsaringing in my ears and so I told him tryin to make the chiming stop everything Id ever done  he sat there and took it  heard about alla my firsts and seconds and thirds and began to loosen his tie
He was hot  And hot and boiling beneath his skin  before I could finish he finished me

He said hed unfuck me and then move on to unfucktheworld  I havent a doubt in im or is passion  kick to the stomach
Hes got the stamina  the gohard rolling set o gears to get the job done and all the passion I have would only evera amounted to me just watching
So I clawed a great mark down his face  begged  remember me  And let him look me in the eye  allowed his morality to sink into me once more  then that onceastrangerman had disappeared into the night and there was not a single sound to be heard for miles

Go On
When it feels like youre being consumed  lean into it
 Effort will never betray you   She said to me
 So give it everything you ever had to give  

I dont know what else I have
I am burned out  it is irreversible  I cannot ever go back home again
I dont know what effort I have left to give

She was not pleased with that
 Whats the point then   She gestured angrily all around   Why care at all  
Shed got me thinking like the black crow and shed got herself prophesizing as the fat white farm cat
 Why were you given anything  If all you were going to do was ferment  

I am festering  I said  Please help me 
But shed have none of it 
 You got gutted  You passed over river death  made your way back to your body again  You fought to keep living  now youre alive finally  
That was all done in desperation  I said  I had no other choice 
 You did not come so far to stop now   She said   Youve killed a man  fed on him  the gods  they saw  They know what we did and how we were starving  all they thought to do was stare  knowing that one day wed consume them too  

I came so far  I looked upon the moon and howled in pain  felt alive again
It wasnt fair  I say and can barely meet her gaze 
 Nothing is  You only get what you can steal  
I came so farbut whats the point if I do not love what I make 
She did not answer me  but instead turned to face the place from where Id came
I cant go back there  I begged  I cannot return 
 So  dont   She said   But you cannot stay here  


I shaped my body
It did as it was told  after much cajoling and coercion
All it took was a little pain in my side
where the corset pushed my ribs closer together
I shaped the vessel I call my home
And made her beautiful

I got told I was good how I was before
But you ought not to listen to voices like those
And besides  people did look at me differently after
Who could deny it 
I shaped my body  I shaped my physical form
And I created a new thing

I was a new thing  living and breathing effort
And everything I had I made myself  fought to get
Do I get worried sometimes  Worried Ive gone too far 
I shaped this body
And now I am sure  Ill never be done 
 
ArsonDream
I dont know when it first became a thought
But the image came to me in a dream 
I was standing up on a hill 
And watching buildings go up in flame 

The grounds smoldered  livid grass green
Smoke rose upwards in a straight line 
And the place Id lived  got licked in flame
The words my mother said You can never go home again

I coulda sworn they were fireworks
By the time the sun went down  and they were still burning
Nobody came to see  nobody rushed to help
It was just that hill and me

I dont know when it first became a thought I had
But I imagined burning that place to the ground
And being heated from the outsidein
Thinking that if I just lived to see thatId be free

When I awoke  dripping in sweat 
Oh  the fiery dream  it stayed with me 
I walked with it clutched in a fist  stuffed in a pocket
And I promised myself the angriest revenge I was capable 
 that Id do the best I was able to

GingerBeer Girl
Gingerbeer girl burned down my throat
She stood with  gingerbeer bottle in hand
Drinking socially without drinking at all
Gingerbeer girl came with a fiery taste 
My lips were hot all night after

Whats the point of you  She asks
Her words are not slurred 
I have no answer and am content 
Just to give her what she wants
I get down on my knees and beg for her
Theres no point to me  I say

Gingerbeer girl has got what she needs
And so she leaves
The party isnt the same once shes gone
The backyards empty and the atmospheres sour
And shes left us all behind and it gets very quiet
And I feel suddenly so alone

ByMyself
I wake and see you in my bed
I think that I am sure  that all of this violence will become too much to bear  that I am dreadfully alone
Alone in this body and I dont know what the cure for that is
I got this place in me and I dont know how to share

I wake and think I am a man come straight from hell
I must remember to bleed and to keep sharp and hope that Ive still got a lot of life remaining for me
Look in the mirror  think Who Are You You Dont Look Like I Remember
I wake and want nothing more to return to sleep and continue to dream

I came from something great and heavy  I got built with shine and care
Yet I am here  awake and feeling so apart from the things that I encounter
I am in my own head and I dont know how to return from that 
I wake and I am angry and feeling helpless and so utterly bymyself that it makes me mad

I am awake and wanting for something that will only bring me disappointment
I got touched and I cried  I felt someone elses hand pressing against my chest and then pushing inside me and I had no words to gasp aloud at the feeling
It was violation  it was sharing  it was all too much as I felt tears streaming and streaming and then just as suddenly I was alone in myself again and thinking about the years Id spent just existing  attempting to pursue that passion I was given
I had dreams and I had loves  but then I had none and more than anything I just wanted peace and to be unbothered

I am so awake and I see you in my bed and think You Cannot Fill This Hole
 I try not to hold that against you but perhaps its too late and I already have

I feel so bymyself these days 

I got tired of getting knocked down
Only to stand  get hit back again

My knees are scraped and my knuckles are bleeding
Theres dirt and stones in the wounds  I scrub at them with a toothbrush dipped in hydrogen peroxide  call myself a bitch when I cry

I got tired and then got mad about it
I was runnin out of bandaids and I had no more clean  white gauze to wrap my joints in

I am dying  I want to say but know that the words require an admission of weakness
I wont be alive for long  My eyes brim with tears that I scrub angrily away
I might be being killed out here  but Ill go with pride 

I got tired of getting knocked down
Only to stand  get hit back again
Im a goddamn coward  I think   dont fight when I should

Things That You Ought Not To Do

You ought not to talk about it  when you dance and get ground on from behind you best say nothing 
Oh  Dont talk about it
You promised me you wouldnt even spend a minute thinking it
Oh  Keep your mouth shut you silly girl

You ought not to say things that you dont mean  when you misspeak  you best clamor over yourself to correct
Oh  You promised me that youd keep me quiet  only say what you felt

You ought not to play games that you will not win

I had no clothes on
And there was no spinning or spiraling
Only an overwhelming feeling of present
 wondering how this would end without fear

I thought that I would be changed  he said 
I heard from everyone I would be different afterwards
We were no different afterwe were no forms changed
 the part of the experience he craved the most was being inside of me

Thats it  I said back  you can have anything
I have everything  but it does not control me
Its for the connection I have with you
Theres no pleasure aside from that

I thought I would be changed  he echoed
Losing your virginity is an important thing

Losing your virginity is nothing  I said
It means nothing at allits your first time thats important
Thats the term youre looking for

He agreed with me  ran his fingers down my back
I have never identified with you more  I want to say
I have never felt more connected with you on the inside
If this is what gave me the opportunity to do so
Id gladly do it again 

I Saw The Future
I saw the future  I want to say  I saw the future and I know how it all plays out 
But nobody is listening  I keep it to myself to avoid seeming overwrought with thoughts of things so far away
I meet him in a bar in the city of Edinburgh   Its been such a long time since Ive seen you   I say 
 It has   He agrees 
And I begin to ask him about how his life is now  so far away from high school  now in our early thirties  I sit and watch him sip at a beer  The bar is welllit and Im enjoying the way the light plays off of his skin when I see him eyeing me upappreciating my body as well 
 This seems to have been meant to be   I say sincerely  and I run my tongue over the backs of my teeth   What a chanceinamillion that I run into you  
I take him back to my place high up on the top floor of a new building in the far lefthand corner of the city  say   Isnt it nice that we get to know each other again  
He remembered who I was then  applied his knowledge carefullyall our dreams were achieved  and we are bigkids now  and he knows just where to touch me  Weve got new tricks  him VS me  and its just peachy  the walls fade and become fuzzy and I run my tongue up the roughness of a shaved jaw 
 Oh its good to be me   I hiss and am reminded so heavily of being touchedall for the very first timeand feeling as if I had been made by God for the very moment I was indulging in   I can feel that again   I insist as I hold him close to me  try not to cry for the good man Ive left behind 
 Ive never met someone whos been my First  since   I kiss him  
 Me neither   He says back   And its kind for us to be allowed to revisit it  
And it is so kind  so kind  and it serves to rekindle the loveliness in me  I feel so young and like Im seventeen and experiencing all of my life over again  heating up  cooling down  just to find myself kissing his neck  his hand under my shirt and running over my breast   Oh  you gave me some amazing times  I find myself saying to him as I run a palm over the contours of his stomach 
 You remind me of what it used to be   He says   And what it used to be was goodI loved being with you  
 I loved being with you too   I say  and nuzzle my cheek against his   Too bad we cant stay here  like this  forever  
 Yes   He says   Too bad we arent still together  
And he leaves for his business conference the next day  I kiss him on the cheek and dont beg him to stay  or insist that he become kept by me  because those times are past  we are grownups now with grownup responsibilities 
I saw the future  I want to say  I saw the future and it was something Ill never fail to remember  it will come to pass  I will think only of it to ask myself how on earth I never realized it before 

There is a flower  sprouting out through my empty skull
I am long dead  currently a small plant is residing inside my empty head
I can feel it grow  push
It wants to get big  growup  make its way as an adult
The sand beneath us is black and fine  and only the moon shines in the sky
The flower grows without sun and without good soil
It forces its way through me until it finally reaches open air
Its growth splits a crack right down my cranium
It asks for no permission and it feels no sorry for how it desecrates my bones
It is life  the responsibility of life is to crunch the dead underfoot as they go

Flower  make your way  I want to say
Do what I failed and make yourself strong
Get big  get fierce 
And grow roots that wrap around your resting place and keep me safe


Little Girl
I have come to terms 
I cannot be a killerokay 
Dont get angry about it 
Even if it is because you are weak 

I played a game and it was
Not the truth when I said
I was not owned by pleasure
I got played 

I think I lied to my heart
I think I lied to myself
And got indulged
And humored

Theres a version of me
Shes a little girl
She turns her nose up at me
BE A MAN

I would yell back at her
I dont know if I can 
But she doesnt want to listen
IF ONLY ID KNOWN ID GROW UP INTO YOU
She spits

This is no game
And I may not continue to pretend to play
I want to cry
That little girl 
She cuts me down to size

BE THE WOLF  BE THE LUMBERJACK
COME HOME TO A WIFE WITH RED HAIR
AND EAT ONLY A SINGLE OF HER CAKES
BEFORE HEADING OUT TO KILL  PROTECT

KEEP YOURSELF SAFE  DO WHAT YOU MUST
DO NOT BARE YOUR NECK
YOU CANNOT LIVE IF YOU ARE WEAK

That little girlshe kept on shouting
Yelling and kicking  screaming
Until I couldnt even hear myself anymore

We The Children

All we asked for in return was a chance to learn
We got underperforming schools  wealth disparity
 its been somewhat unhelpful for our test scores
To watch our peers finger paint with the contents of our soft bodies
 gunshots become the sound popcorn popping
 we remain as the kernels burning in the bottom of the pot
Simmering in the oil 

We marched on the capital  declared this occupation unlawful
 in violation of our constitutional rights 
 we got laughed out of town
It was declared the largest case of forgetting your roots ever
You used to be us  We told the men in Congress
And we will not forget about what you have done here today 

We watched as it was us  the children  who cracked the segregation egg
 how we got sent off to die in wars we did not begin but did not complain
We watched as companies took advantage of our political platforms  used them to sell us carbonated beverages
Youre out of touch  We said
And we will not be taken advantage of like this 

 finally  our nations grownups acquiesced
And allowed us to go to school
We marched up the front steps  got greeted by the barrel of a gun  a disgruntled classmate
 before we could ever blink
We got blown away 


We The Children
We stood and said
Well fight in your wars
Well work your minimum wage jobs
Well play your games 
 all we asked for in return was a chance to learn
We got underperforming schools  wealth disparity
 its been somewhat unhelpful for our test scores
To watch our peers finger paint with the contents of our soft bodies
 gunshots become the sound popcorn popping
 we remain as the kernels burning in the bottom of the pot
Simmering in the oil 

We marched on the capital  declared this occupation unlawful
 in violation of our constitutional rights 
 we got laughed out of town
It was declared the largest case of forgetting your roots ever
You used to be us  We told the men in Congress
And we will not forget about what you have done here today 

We watched as it was us  the children  who cracked the segregation egg
 rallied against the Vietnam War
We watched as companies took advantage of our social platforms  used them to sell us carbonated beverages
Youre out of touch  We said
And we will not be taken advantage of like this 

 finally  our nations grownups acquiesced
And allowed us to go to school
We marched up the front steps  got greeted by the barrel of a gun  a disgruntled classmate
 before we could ever blink
We got blown away 


Show Me Home
I had not thought ahead to what Id say
 when the time came 
I said  Show me home 

Thats my little planet  I said  and I was so proud 
Thats the place where I grew up 

I was a million lightyears from where Id came
 I could feel it pulling me back to where Id been born 
But I was going to die here 
And Id never see my home again 

I wanted to be buried on Earthin the dirt 
I wanted to get eaten by worms
I wanted to die and have all my molecules returned back again
I wanted to grow sunflowers out my chest 
And I wanted to become wet  good soil fit for farming 

I can feel the tears  wet on my cheeks
It isnt too much to ask 
To die in the peace of your own planet 

But people from space  they have no home
And dont think about that sort of thing 
Ill die here  its breaking my heart 

My last thoughts are of home
And the little blue hologram floating in front of me
It continues to spin
Even after I am done 

The Sand 
Theres sand everywhere
Its in the blinds
And blocking the doorways
Its filling the house up 
And falling from the ceilings

This sand is rising
And its cold and wet down by my feet
I wade through itdetermined to get back to where
Its pouring in
And to plug up the hole

Im bailing sand out the window 
But it rises to my waist
This sand is not a metaphor
It is real  actual  fucking sand
And its all over the place

All I can think is 
What a mess this is making
What is happening 
Where is all of this sand coming from 

The sand has risen to my chest
Im trying to swim towards the door
Its like walking through molasses
But instead of molasses its sand
And its everywhere 

I clucked my tongue and that hound
He came arunnin to stand by my knee

Oh hound  I say
Ive got so much life left to live
I fear that my stagnant nature will get the best of me
And Ill eat my days without pausing to savor

The hound did not reply to me
Instead  he cocked his head and breathed a heavy sigh

Whats Jonathan Been Up To Lately
Jonathans been getting the best of me  lately 
Jonathans been stuck under my skin  been everywhere Ive looked
Jonathans been keeping me up at night
Jonathans been tryin to kill me

Hey  it aint okay to get eaten up when youre playing a game of chewspit
Get your head in the game  stand up to say what you mean

Hey browneyed Jonathanboy  hows it goin 
Hey pretty  pretty birdhowve you been hangin 
Hey there smug kittycat  whats in your whiskers 

Jonathan  I shout  Stop this occupation 
This is not alright  it is time to see yourself on out before I begin to cry
Not fair  but hey buddy didnt I tell you
Someone wants to cut a hole in you and fuck you through it
And that someone is me

Hey  Jonathan  I call
Hey  wait up for me 
Remind me that I can get anything I want
Remind me that I can have anything I do so please
All of this is mine  its mine to use as I see fit

Jonathan get outta my head
Jonathan better get slept or hes gonna get dead

Wolf Man
I want to be the wolfish man all decorated in tattoos
When I approach that old farmhouse in my dreams
I see him tending to the sheep

I practice every day
I look myself hard in the mirror and go
Hey browneyed raven  hows it goin 
I leer and say
Hey pretty  pretty birdhowve you been hangin 

I want everything
I want everything I seeI want to devour it whole
I want to eat and eat and eat

Hey Wolf Man  I say
Are you paying attention to me 

Im not in love  I deny
Im just filled with jealousy 

I want to be the wolfish man
I see how he cleans his teeth
I see how he chomps his partners clean in half

How could I want for anything less 


Religious
Ill insist that I never hated men
But I always thought that cross around your neck was stupid
I always thought Who do you think youre foolin 

Redfaced and panting
Maybe Im just jealous  I think  as I begin to sprint
Ive been many different people  it feels
But a core of pine  blood sacrifices have kept me young
 I aint dead yet

I always thought that you were too sure
I always thought You think youll ever be redeemed 
I met all the women in that bible you so admire
 all of them got fed to hounds that ripped them apart
Or written out of history entirely

Ill insist that I never hated men 
But men sought fit to take everything that they could fit their fist around
And maybe Im just jealous I didnt think of it first
I shoulda taken as much as I could hold  then
Stolen away in the night  laughing

Time to Go Home

Theres no joke here  my kitten isnt ever coming home
I struggled with wanting to fuck another man  told him so
 he just laughed and nodded and asked me how often I thought about it
Every day  I sayand try to keep from looking pained
Its so much easier  now that Im able to just say it 
Now that I dont have to fight it

Wont I ask him for permission  Permission to bring another man home 
Permission seeking peasant  lady from the forestdrag your mutt home  collar him if hes bad
How delicious  It would only be the once  and afterwards I might even die
Theres no joke here  I dont wanna ask in fear
I couldnt deal with it  I would lose my absolutely shattered mind
It wouldnt go great

Time to come home  and be satisfied
Time to come home  and eat
Time to go out and seek those things which you wish to meet

Fantasies
Determined to Get Some
I acted out scenes of drama
I said Ill be King  youll serve all my needs
 I can get you to do anything I please

There was a moment  in which I dreamed
The most powerful man dropped to his knees
 he begged for me
 I sent him crying away

Theres not much to say 
About powerfantasies anyways
I said I want to make it clear
I would never do that to you
But its too late  thats a strange wariness
In his eyes now

I want to take the things I desire
But I recognize that in  polite society 
You must play the longcon
You must wear leather skirts  cut your long nails
In order to get the job done

Theres no man I couldnt dream of
Giving up to a higher power
Should a sacrifice be demanded
But oh I might decry For shame 
While leaving him out to dry
 have his bones bleached in the desert sun 

Crossroads
In my dream  I visit a crossroads
It is night
And a man stands there 
Leant against a wooden water tower
Waiting for me

He says my name aloud
 I wonder how he knows me
The corner of his mouth lifts
 he says  We seal this deal with a kiss 

I have met this man only once since
And then I was not dreaming
Walking down a dirt path
Great fields of green grass hem me in
And I turn the bend  only to see that
Great water tower I saw five years ago
In a dream I had when I was thirteen

The sun is high in the sky
And there he is waiting for me again 
Its been a long time  friend 
He says 
And it will be a long time till we meet again 

The man  seems serious now
I must ask you  was it worth it  He says
Would you go back  and choose everything the same 
What would you do  now that you know better 

Its taken me this long to be honest with myself
And I want so badly to tell him the truth
 Man of the Crossroads   I say
 I want to be at peace  
 But I worry  that  now  knowing what I know 
 I would not choose what I chose  

He nods thoughtfully  and says
Youll come back here once more 
Sometime soon
But for now  continue on your way

I leave that man in the dust of the road
Shading himself under the water tower
And hope that what he says is a lie
 that I never find myself in that place
And that this meeting will be the last time
He ever sees me

From This Day
From this day forwardit is decreed
That we may no longer write about
Things such as God  love  and depression
As you will be considered trite
We may no longer write about
Things such as flowers sunsets  or womens bodies
As they are compared to various delicious fruits
Because honestly enough already
 you should be a bit more ashamed that thats
The best you could come up with 

In Conclusion
There was a poem I wrote
About a spider
 my dad
But Im too embarrassed to share
Now that Im some years older

I have learned If you are funny
You are absolved from coming off as fauxdeep
 you do not have to worry about anything
Except  perhaps  taking the joke too far
Until its only you  laughing along with yourself

I have blinked and discovered that now
I am old and giggling at my reflection
I duck down underneath the sink and hope to hell
I can escape from this lady
Before she eats me
 before I recognize her as me

Oh  armchair philosopher  wont you give it a rest
 let us all just get on 
Oh  maninme  wont you sit down
 be at peace 

In Conclusion Welcome back home again 
 

Pomegranates
Im eating pomegranates
With the woman of my dreams
She looks at me
Red juice dripping from her chin

In the summer time we swim together
I pick the shiniest rocks
 present them to her
 she makes them into beads

Its warm  lovely here
Its heavy  blooming here
How long does this last
How long before Im asked to leave

This Makes Me A Man
I promised Id be a man about it
So I put that dog down
And buried her beneath a coniferous tree

I promised Id be a man about it
So when I began to cry
I told myself it was just this once
I continued to shovel dirt

By the time the sun simmered low in the sky
I was spread thin like butter
On freshly toasted bread
I think This makes me a man

I return home and set the shovel down
I return home and sit alone
I return home and spread my skirt
And wonder what it means that I am now a man
  
Black Waters
The great black snake eyes me
Youre swimming in my waters
His tongue flicks at me as he
Slowly unwraps himself
And leaves the marble womans thigh

His level gaze  and bright yellow eyes
Look through me and into my head
Maybe this is prophesy
Maybe this is warning
He slithers closer and draws up
Until hes the only thing I see

I tread inky water and watch
As he comes closer
I reach my hand out and he
Coils around my wet arm  higher  higher
Before settling partially on my shoulder

Or perhaps  he hisses in my ear
This is nothing but a dream
