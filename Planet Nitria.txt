\f0\fs24 \cf0 Planet Nitria\
\
Id like to make an announcement The Captain says hitting his glass with a spoon Hes standing on the stage with the musicians who have stopped their playing to let him speak\
The crowd settles down and I turn my head slightly to listena drink still in my hand  \
Weve done it againanother successful trade mission completed and weve all arrived here in Nitria another four years of our lives given to doing what amounts to an incredibly difficult job He looks down at us his crew and the lines in his face grow deeper in the low yellow lighting of the planets perpetually setting sun Its a hard job being away for so longyou all know it Not everyone can do what we do But weve made it to the halfway pointfour years until were back home again congratulations everyone He straightens and with a smile says So take your longdeserved break and relax The drinks are free and the musics good See you all at oeighthundred hours in a weeks time\
The crowd lets out a cheer and the band begins to play again The Captain steps down from the stage and mingles with the crowd Im standing near the back of the open terrace with a sparkling glass of the alien planets popular homeworld drink in my hand\
Nitrias nickname of Planet Paradise is well deserved with its slightly humid atmosphere a nice change to the dry ship air Im used to breathing and the heady smell of the thickly flowering tropical plants perfumes the air of the terrace and surrounding gardens Fat green vines with big yellow flowers with lolling pink tongues crawl up and down the stone columns that serve as the entrance to the hotel and travel along the roof to hang low down to the ground so that you have to part them to walk through to the other side Theres the sound of running water coming from the fountains behind me contained within the garden and the gardens accompanying maze made from hedges twice as tall as me\
The soft warmth of the sun on my skin and the humidity are making me tired and I struggle to keep my eyes open I straighten and turn away from the festivities and make my way down into the expansive gardens\
Ive never been much for plants but the ones in the garden are beautiful You can get Nitria flowers back on Earth but theyre expensive and look as if the soul has been sucked out of them But these these are exquisite I walk on the main path which appears to be made from crushed coral each step crunching underneath my shoes When I come to the entrance to the maze I slip my shoes off drain my glass and set it all neatly out of the way next to a fiery red hedge The path changes abruptly from coral to beds of white carpetlike flowers that sit low to the ground and feel soft and spongy underneath my feet\
Im not worried about getting lost I have a week before Im needed back at the ship so I have time to wander So I wander until I can no longer hear the music of the party and all thats left is the sound of gently rustling leaves running water and my own footsteps\
After a while I come to a clearing filled with what looks like English bluebells the size of trees When I reach a hand up to touch the lowest of the drooping blooms it makes a soft tinkling noise and showers me unexpectedly in white pollen I brush the pollen from my face feeling strangely unperturbed by it and the fact that my black dress pants are now covered in a soft white dusting In fact its more than simply unperturbedI feel\
I let out a giggle\
My God I feel amazing\
The sun seems to shine brighter and warmer and the colors surrounding me rise in their resolution My senses are sharpened and the surface of my skin tingles gently in the slight breeze\
An easy smile spreads across my face and I continue away from the giant bluebells making my way deeper into the maze I come across a wall of towering sunflowers I run my fingers gently over the thick stalks and feel their sharp texture Something beyond the sunflowers catches the sun and glints Curious I start to push the stalks to the side when the sunflowers let out a soft sigh and seemed to bend away from one another creating a gap just large enough to squeeze through to the other side \
I survey the clearing Its an enclosed section of the maze containing no entrances or exits I turn back to look at the wall of sunflowers they sigh heavily again and the stalks bend back into place and theres no indication that there ever was an entrance In the center of the maze there is what looks like a deep pool The water is such a dark blue that its almost black In the center of the pond is a large statue of a woman about seven feet tall made of marble She stands washing her hair while a great snake winds its way up her legits tongue flicked out to taste the air just below her navel The water of the pool laps gently at her toes\
In that moment its the most beautiful thing Ive ever seen Without thinking I begin to strip With my top off Im halfway through unbuckling my dress pants when I hear a rustling from a faroff hedge I pause and wonder if its perhaps local wildlife Possible but as of yet I havent seen any nonaquatic wildlife at all Not even birds I glance back at the statue of the woman and the snakemaybe its a snake Surely Nitria has them or else why would one be depicted here \
I decide I dont care and finish undressing I leave my clothes on the ground and slip into the cool water of the pool My feet dont touch the bottom and I wonder if I would even be able to swim down far enough to reach it\
Another hedge rustles This time the sound comes from the same side of the clearing with the sunflowers I sink down under the water until just my eyes and the top of my head can be seen and wait I hear more rustling and then the wall of sunflowers lets out a slow sigh before bending away from one another to create a gap A man slides through the gap and an electric shock runs its way down my spine\
Jonathan DuBois I hear it as a hiss in my head He looks around for a moment taking in the statue of the woman and the great snake before his eyes finally come to rest on my pile of abandoned clothing\
I raise myself up so my face is uncovered by the inky water Have you come to join me Jonathan\
His eyes flick to me and briefly widen in surprise Lilith He asks\
Who else I say My voice is low and soft but it carries over the water and is easily heard in the silence of the clearing\
He chuckles lowly Yes who else He has white pollen all over his shirt and in his hair He makes a halfhearted attempt to brush it off one of his shoulders He pauses and he looks between me and the pile of the clothes on the grass He seems to consider a moment before moving his hands to the buttons of his shirt undoing them one by one Focused intently on the task he only looks up from it to stare at me as hes shrugging his way out of his top \
Theres not space in my brain to wonder whats happening The part of me that usually works to provide analysis has quieted and instead it just feels as if Im existing entirely in the moment Each thing that happens inevitable Each action taken completely and totally natural All of my senses are on fire and yet I feel completely at ease\
I submerge myself underwater and when I come up for air a minute later Jonathan is standing near the edge of the pool with only his underwear on\
Arent you going to look away He asks\
Why Do you want me to I say quietly\
He shrugs and his cheeks flush slightly I wonder where all his bravado has gone I turn my back towards him and look up at the statue of the woman From this position the snake appears to be looking up at the woman I stare unabashedly at them both when suddenly the snake turns its head to look at me It flicks its black tongue at me and its yellow eyes gleam dangerously Youre swimming in my pool it hisses\
A small splash from behind me and I turn my head to look and I see bubbles erupting from the place where Jonathan has dived into the pool I whip my head back around to look at the snake but its back in its original position looking up at the woman no indication it had ever moved Before I can consider it any further I feel the water shift behind me and turn again to find Jonathan inches from me\
He glances from my face up to the statue and then back to me again Its a nice statue isnt it\
Yes I agree Its beautiful\
He pushes his wet hair back with the palm of his hand His face is serious even a little sad Why dont you like me Lilith\
Im taken aback by the question Why dont I like you I repeat dumbly\
Yes He says Why dont you like me\
There are a lot of reasons I say after my mind stops reeling and I find my mental footing once again There are a lot of reasons why someone wouldnt like you\
Yes but I dont care why someone wouldnt like me He lifts a hand in exasperation a somewhat impressive feat given were both treading water I want to know why you dont like me\
Didnt we already have this conversation I say almost to myself Back on Terra you asked me the same thing\
You never answered me He says lowly \
Im pretty sure I told you that I liked you just fine I tell him and wonder if I should put some space between us\
I just want you to like me Lilith He says and seems surprised at his own words\
Whatever hes feeling though its nothing compared to whats happening in my own head I dont have the mental bandwidth to have this conversation right now Something is wrong with me everything is slow and stilted The idea that Jonathan cared what I thought about him isnt new but that he would want my thoughts to be positive for some reason that seems devastating\
I like you just fine Jonathan I say weakly I like you just fine\
He shakes his head Thats not what I mean\
I dont think were quite ourselves I say slowly putting it together I think the pollen from the bluebells might be more than just pollen\
He furrows his brow as if struggling to connect the dots It got all over you too\
I nod\
Hmm He says and then shrugs I feel fine\
So do I I say But Im not sure Im I trail off unsure Its true I do feel fineamazing actually if a bit muddy on what I should and should not be doing Its been a long time since Ive felt this at peace with myself Theres no ugly voice whispering in the back of my head theres no unsureness theres only an intense clarity of self Im not sure Im quite myself I finish lamely\
Me neither But maybe thats alright He says and his eyes burn\
I take a quick breath of air and push myself underwater and with a powerful kick glide underneath the surface to one of manmade walls of the pool I reach my palms out in front of me to feel for the wall When I finally reach it I emerge from the water and rest my elbows on the tiles large flat tiles that rim the pool so I no longer have to tread I take a deep breath of air and wonder why it feels like Im drowning\
Jonathan leisurely swims up behind me and rests his head on my shoulder his right arm reaches forward to grab the wall in order to support himself A portion of his chest is pressed up against my side and I can feel the warmth of his skin\
Arent you lonely Lilith He says softly\
Everyone is lonely I return bitterly\
Sometimes I can feel it when you look at me He tells me and I wonder if hes ever talked like this before Not in all the years Ive known him have I heard him speak the way hes speaking now It radiates off of you\
I dont say anything I just stare straight ahead at the hedges\
You dont need to be that way He says gently You dont have to be so lonely He turns his head slightly and kisses my shoulder Its okay to not be like that\
I want to be hard and push him away Tell him to fuck off shove myself out of the pool and throw my clothes on before stalking angrily away and out of the maze Instead I find that I cant bring myself to do that This has been a long time coming and it would only be foolish to deny it\
I turn my head to look at him It was easier to hate you when you were a dick\
He laughs Im still that Im sure when whatever the fuck that pollen is doing to us wears off well both be back to our normal selves His mouth twists Until then we can do whatever we want He lifts his head from my shoulder and faces me And after that we can blame it all on an alien plant on an alien planet and never have to speak of it again\
Yes I say I feel cogent and this feels right\
Jonathan is looking at me his pupils are large and dilated His lips are slightly parted I move the hand that is gripping the wall from between the two of us and touch the side of his face I place my thumb over his bottom lip and drag it down slightly He looks just beautiful as he ever has his strong nose pretty eyes and lovely cheekbones The tip of his tongue swipes over my thumb and I draw my hand away\
He waits patiently for me to make a move Id never imagined he was capable of that sort of restraint or consideration It endears me to him and Im struck by the realization that if he and I were in our right minds this would be a violent clash of personalities as both of us tried to gain ground on the other It would be occupation rather than invitation\
I prefer this I think\
Lilith He says roughly nearly pleading\
I close the gap between the two of us and our lips meet Its soft and tentative almost sweet if it werent for the tongue and it lasts for about a minute before he pulls away\
