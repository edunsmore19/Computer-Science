\f0\fs24 \cf0 Sleek soft feathers glide through glimmering water\
The understated hero of every pond\
The mother bird leads each son and daughter\
The youngest waddles clumsily it\'92s soft hair blonde\
\
The kind duck waddles to the pond\
A mother leading a small heard\
The young ones with their hair so blonde\
Oh what a sweet sight what a bird\
\
The mallard has a regal stance\
King of aquatics is his rank \
His majesty casts quite a trance\
Lesser birds follow at his flank\
\
But the spry duck has a dark side\
Demonic tendencies alive\
Scary will make you want to hide\
No other animal can thrive\
\
But still strange duck I love you so\
Your scary side only I know\
\
\
\
Aquatic fowl\
My beautiful simple friend\
Loyal like a duck\
Humans cannot reach your level\
Not as amazing as ducks\
\
Ducky waddles fast\
Ducky flops around the pond\
Aquatic mammal\
\
The duck is not a silly bird funny\
Jokes are not their forte Instead they willl tell you things\
About aquatic witchcraft wise spells are\
Only known to ducks their power lurks everywhere\
\
One day, along a normal bog\
A nice duck met a gentle frog\
At one, each a friend\
Never did it end\
A demon duck A Stalker frog\
The duck\
Waddles away\
He shall be leaving now\
 I watch him toddle slowly through \
Goodbye\
\
\
\
There was a young demon from York\
He waddled around like a dork\
My god Hear that cluck\
In fact he is a duck\
You put away the pitchfork\
\
\
\
Hear that sweet sound it is a cluck\
I can now tell you it is a duck\
He eats his brother\
Just like no other\
Cannibal duck Dude what the fuck\
