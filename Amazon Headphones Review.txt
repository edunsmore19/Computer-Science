I buy exclusively these earbuds after first purchasing them on a whim. I will probably continue to buy them until either they stop production of this particular line or I die. Would strongly recommend, good sound, nice bass, and they stay in your ears nicely. By far the best earbuds I've ever purchased, reliable, and cheap.
