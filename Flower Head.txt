There is a flower, sprouting out through my empty skullI am long dead & currently a small plant is residing inside my empty headI can feel it grow & pushIt wants to get big & grow-up & make its way as an adultThe sand beneath us is black and fine, and only the moon shines in the skyThe flower grows without sun and without good soilIt forces its way through me until it finally reaches open airIts growth splits a crack right down my craniumIt asks for no permission and it feels no sorry for how it desecrates my bonesIt is life & the responsibility of life is to crunch the dead underfoot as they goFlower, make your way! I want to sayDo what I failed and make yourself strongGet big & get fierce And grow roots that wrap around your resting place and keep me safe
