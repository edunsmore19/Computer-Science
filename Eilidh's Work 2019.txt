Pomegranates
I’m eating pomegranates
With the woman of my dreams
She looks at me
Red juice dripping from her chin

In the summer time we swim together
I pick the shiniest rocks
& present them to her
& she makes them into beads

It’s warm & lovely here
It’s heavy & blooming here
How long does this last
How long before I’m asked to leave

This Makes Me A Man
I promised I’d be a man about it
So I put that dog down
And buried her beneath a coniferous tree

I promised I’d be a man about it
So when I began to cry
I told myself it was just this once
I continued to shovel dirt

By the time the sun simmered low in the sky
I was spread thin like butter
On freshly toasted bread
I think: This makes me a man

I return home and set the shovel down
I return home and sit alone
I return home and spread my skirt
And wonder what it means that I am now a man
  
Black Waters
The great black snake eyes me
You’re swimming in my waters
His tongue flicks at me as he
Slowly unwraps himself
And leaves the marble woman’s thigh

His level gaze, and bright yellow eyes
Look through me and into my head
Maybe this is prophesy
Maybe this is warning
He slithers closer and draws up
Until he’s the only thing I see

I tread inky water and watch
As he comes closer
I reach my hand out and he
Coils around my wet arm, higher, higher
Before settling partially on my shoulder

Or perhaps, he hisses in my ear
This is nothing but a dream
